<div>The mouse superior colliculus is a highly conserved laminar structure, locating at the dorsal midbrain. It is organized into several synaptic layers, including superfical layers (sSC), intermediate layers&nbsp; and deep layers, each of which has distinct sources of innervation. The superfical layerser of SC receives more than 85% of retinal inputs (Ellis et al., 2016). Besides, within each SC lamina</div>
