<h3 data-label="864441" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><div>The mouse superior colliculus is a highly conserved laminar structure, locating at the dorsal midbrain. It is organized into several synaptic layers, including superfical layers (sSC), intermediate layers&nbsp; and deep layers, each of which has distinct sources of innervation. The superfical layerser of SC receives more than 85% of retinal inputs (Ellis et al., 2016). The visual inputs are also mapped topographyically with respect to the bisual field, and are alligned in retiotopic register with each other. Firstly, contralateral RGCs along the temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina  project  along the anterior-posterior (A-P) of the SC. The dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC.&nbsp; Additionally, ipsilateral RGCs and V1 exons terminate in a slightly deeper SGS lamina and are retinotopically aligned with the contralateral rtinocollcilular map.&nbsp; (Figure.1)</div><h3 data-label="822194" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Distinct SC cell types</h3><div>In the mouse, by using morphological analysis, visual response properties and molecular expression pattern, Gale and Murphy (2014, 2018) identified five distinct cells types in the SC, including wide-field neurons, horizontal cells, stellate cells, narrow-field cells. They also differ in the target structures to which they project, suggesting that the features they detect are important for different behaviors. The visual stimulus preferences and the projection targets for each type are summarized in Figure2. Besides, the superfical superior colliculus contains diversive neuroal cell types. By screening different molecular markers with layer-specific expression pattern, Byun et al identified at least 10 neuronal types in the (young p10-p13) mouse superfical superior colliculus.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="386661" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Behaviors mediated by the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h3><div><i>Question: why the superior colliculus is recognized as a critical node in mediating innate behaviors?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</i></div><div>The mouse superior colliculus receives direct inputs from retina and routes this information to distinct downstream projection areas to control diverse innate behaviors.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="212849" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The superior colliculus mediates visually-guided behaviors</h3><div>Yilmaz and Meister for the first time showed a overhead looming stimulus that mimics an arterial predator initiates avoidance behaviors (Yilmaz and Meister 2013). However, the neuronal circuit via the superior colliculus mediating the behaviors is not known. With the identification&nbsp;of the cell types in the colliculus, development of specific virus labelling and optogenetic progress, several pathways via the superior colliculus have been investigated. </div>
