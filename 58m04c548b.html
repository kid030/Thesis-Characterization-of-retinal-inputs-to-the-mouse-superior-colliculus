<div>The mouse superior colliculus is a highly conserved laminar structure, locating at the dorsal midbrain. It is organized into several synaptic layers, including superfical layers (sSC), intermediate layers&nbsp; and deep layers, each of which has distinct sources of innervation. The superfical layerser of SC receives more than 85% of retinal inputs (Ellis et al., 2016). The visual inputs are also mapped topographyically with respect to the bisual field, and are alligned in retiotopic register with each other. Firstly, contralateral RGCs along the temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina  project  along the anterior-posterior (A-P) of the SC. The dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC.&nbsp; additionally, ipsilateral RGCs and V1</div>
