<h3 data-label="864441" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><div>The mouse superior colliculus is a highly conserved laminar structure, locating at the dorsal midbrain. It is organized into several synaptic layers, including superfical layers (sSC), intermediate layers&nbsp; and deep layers, each of which has distinct sources of innervation. The superfical layerser of SC receives more than 85% of retinal inputs (Ellis et al., 2016). The visual inputs are also mapped topographyically with respect to the bisual field, and are alligned in retiotopic register with each other. Firstly, contralateral RGCs along the temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina  project  along the anterior-posterior (A-P) of the SC. The dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC.&nbsp; Additionally, ipsilateral RGCs and V1 exons terminate in a slightly deeper SGS lamina and are retinotopically aligned with the contralateral rtinocollcilular map.&nbsp; (Figure.1)</div><h3 data-label="822194" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Distinct SC cell types</h3><div>In the mouse, by using morphological analysis, visual response properties and molecular expression pattern, Gale and Murphy (2014, 2018) identified five distinct cells types in the SC, including wide-field neurons, horizontal cells, stellate cells, narrow-field cells. They also differ in the target structures to which they project, suggesting that the features they detect are important for different behaviors. The visual stimulus preferences and the projection targets for each type are summarized in Figure2. Besides, the superfical superior colliculus contains diversive neuroal cell types. By screening different molecular markers with layer-specific expression pattern, Byun et al identified at least 10 neuronal types in the (young p10-p13) mouse superfical superior colliculus.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="386661" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Behaviors mediated by the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h3><div><i>Question: why the superior colliculus is recognized as a critical node in mediating innate behaviors?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</i></div><div>The mouse superior colliculus receives direct inputs from retina and routes this information to distinct downstream projection areas to control diverse innate behaviors.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="212849" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The superior colliculus mediates visually-guided behaviors</h3><div>Yilmaz and Meister for the first time showed an overhead looming stimulus that mimics an arterial predator efficiently triggers fleeing-to-nest or freezing responses in mice (Yilmaz and Meister 2013). Later on,&nbsp; people found the superior colliculus is a critical node in mediating the innate behaviors.&nbsp; Wei et al identified a&nbsp;subpopulation of excitatory neurons in the superior colliculus that travels through the lateral posterior nucleus (also known as lateral pulvinar, LP) targeting the amygdala respond to and mediated a freezing response to a looming stimulus.&nbsp;Another group by applying a flashing light, induced a transient suspended locomotion behavior and found a top-down pathway from L5 neurons in the visual cortex to superior colliculus is involved in this arrest behavior (Liang et al., 2015). However, the neuronal circuit via the superior colliculus mediating the behaviors is not known. With the identification&nbsp;of the cell types in the colliculus, development of specific virus labeling and optogenetic progress, several pathways via different superior colliculus neuronal celly types have been investigated.&nbsp;Shang et al found PV positive neurons in the superior colliculus targeting Pbg that transmits further to the amygdala triggered freezing and escape responses (Shang et al 2015).

The rules by which parallel inputs are routed to downstream targets are poorly understood. The superior colliculus mediates a set of innate behaviors, receiving input from &gt;30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviorally important targets including the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus. Combining transsynaptic circuit tracing with in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, we observed a projection-specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. Neurons projecting to the pulvinar or the parabigeminal nucleus showed strongly biased sampling from four cell types each, while six others innervated both pathways. The visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells correlated well with those of their disynaptic targets. These findings open the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus.</div><h2 data-label="448443" class="ltx_title_subsection">Introduction</h2><div>The nervous system nervous system is built built from a large set large set of diverse neuronal cell diverse neuronal cell types that work together work together to process process information and generate behavior generate behavior (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib104">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</a>).
