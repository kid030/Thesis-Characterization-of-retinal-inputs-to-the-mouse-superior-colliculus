<div>Next, we combined our physiological data sets (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig7">Figure 7</a>) with our assessment of the biases with which the different retinal ganglion cell types innervate the colliculo-pulvinar and colliculo-parabigeminal circuits (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>) to ask if we could explain the similarities and differences we observed in the responses of neurons in the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6</a>). This comparison revealed three clear relationships. First, both circuits receive input from cell types that respond during the expansion phase of the expanding disc stimulus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig7">Figure 7</a>). This included inputs from cluster&nbsp;6 that innervates both circuits. These neurons are transient OFF-alpha cell, also known as the ‘looming detector’ (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib68">Münch et al., 2009</a>). In addition, cluster 1, sustained OFF-alpha cells, innervate both circuits and respond during the presentation of expanding discs (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig7">Figure 7</a>). This shared input to the colliculo-pulvinar and colliculo-parabigeminal circuits from neurons that respond to the presentation of dark expanding discs is matched by the shared response properties in the target nuclei (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6</a>). Second, in accordance with different direction-selectivity of the two target nuclei (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6</a>), we found that direction-selective retinal ganglion cells have a strong preference for the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Finally, a striking&nbsp;difference was observed between the responses of retinal ganglion cells innervating the different circuits and the responses of neurons in the target nuclei to full-field stimuli. The ‘chirp’ stimulus produces robust responses in most retinal ganglion cells but fails to illicit responses in either the posterior pulvinar, or the parabigeminal nucleus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>), which might be due to non-linear integration of retinal inputs or summation of opposite signed weights.</div>
