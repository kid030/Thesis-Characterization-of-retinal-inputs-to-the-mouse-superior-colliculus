<div></div><h2 data-label="720115" class="ltx_title_subsection">Anatomy of retinal inputs to the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuits</h2><div>The morphology of 658 ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;241) and colliculo-pulvinar (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;417) circuit were extracted. The anatomy of labeled ganglion cells was recovered by staining the retinas with antibodies against GFP (binding to the GCaMP6s) and ChAT, an internal marker of depth formed by starburst amacrine cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib79">Sanes and Masland, 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib88">Sümbül et al., 2014a</a>). A semi-automated image processing routine was applied to high-resolution confocal image stacks of each ganglion cell that enables a precise quantification of their dendritic morphology (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib88">Sümbül et al., 2014a</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib89">Sümbül et al., 2014b</a>). The cells showed a variety of morphologies:~7% had bistratified dendritic trees (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;49), either co-stratifying with the ChAT-bands, or stratifying outside the ChAT bands (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1D</a>);~17% were mono-stratified with dendrites below the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;110);~50% had their dendrites restricted to the region between the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;326); and&nbsp;~26% had dendrites stratifying exclusively above the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;173;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1</a>). We calculated for each cell the area covered by the dendrites and created a depth profile of the dendritic tree (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). Our data set contains cells with dendritic field diameters ranging from 57 to 468 µm (median: 194 µm), similar to the reported range of 80 to 530 µm (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib3">Badea and Nathans, 2004</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib12">Coombs et al., 2006</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib53">Kong et al., 2005</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib90">Sun et al., 2002</a>).</div><div>Comparing the size and stratification of retinal ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuits revealed two basic trends. First, cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit had larger dendritic trees (median: 279 μm) than the cells innervating the colliculo-pulvinar circuit (median: 190 μm; p&lt;0.01, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon rank sum test;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1E</a>). This was true at each stratification level (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1F</a>). Second, the stratification depth of cells innervating each circuit had distinct distributions. While the colliculo-pulvinar circuit showed strong bias for sampling from neurons stratifying between (55.6%) and above (29.3%) the ChAT-bands, the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit sampled more evenly from each stratification level (bistratified 14.5%, below ChAT-bands 25.3%, between 39.0%, above 21.2%;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1G</a>). We found that these differences are not due to a bias in the retinotopic location of the sampled cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>).</div>
