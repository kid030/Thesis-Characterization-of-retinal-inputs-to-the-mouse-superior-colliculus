One wheel contained a set of natural density (ND) filters (Thorlabs NE10B-A to NE50B-A), with optical densities from 1 (ND1) to 5 (ND5), that were used to control the stimulus intensity in logarithmic steps. Another wheel contained a set of filters, that were used to achieve defined transmission properties.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Recordings were performed with filters decreasing the stimulus intensity by 1-2 log units. For two-photon targeted patch-clamp, we use 750nm filter&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The projector produced a light spectrum that ranged from ~430nm to ~670nm. The power produced by the projector was 240 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at the retina. The output of the projector ranges from black (0) to white (255) pixels. All stimuli were gray-scale images with pixel values between 0 (black) and 255 (white). The background was kept at 30 (gray). The stimuli were balanced so that the mean intensity over time equaled background. The following visual stimuli were used for retinal recordings:&nbsp;</div><div></div><ol><li>Full-field 'chirp' modulation: A full-field stimulus based on the 'chirp' stimulus (Baden et al., 2016) starting with slow transitions gray-black-gray-white-gray ()</li></ol><h1 data-label="942511" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div></div><div></div>
