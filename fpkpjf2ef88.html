<div>Studies investigating the organization of retinal inputs to single cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus have suggested that there is a large degree of fuzziness/variability in the information each neuron receives from the retina (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib37">Hammer et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib57">Liang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib67">Morgan et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib74">Rompani et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib77">Roson et al., 2019</a>). Here, we demonstrate that in the superior colliculus a high degree of regularity exists if one considers the projection targets. This data suggests there are strict limits on the degree of mixing of retinal ganglion cell inputs that occurs in the superior colliculus, where each output pathway has access to a distinct, only partially overlapping, set of visual information encoded by the retina. The observed regularity could exist either because the superior colliculus has a more ‘hard-wired’ architecture; or because we focused on projection-specific disynaptic circuits. When considering the layer-specific targets of the lateral geniculate nucleus in the visual cortex, Cruz-Martin et al. suggest that direction-selective neurons are preferentially sampled by layer one projecting neurons of the thalamus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib14">Cruz-Martín et al., 2014</a>). We propose that understanding the specific input structure to neurons and cell types with different projection profiles will greatly enhance our ability to create mechanistic models of how information from the sensory periphery informs the triggering of behaviors and decision making.</div><h2 data-label="254111" class="ltx_title_subsection">CHAPTER2: Characterization of GABAergic neurons in the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h2>
