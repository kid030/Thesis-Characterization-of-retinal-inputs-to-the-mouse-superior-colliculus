<div>Studies investigating the organization of retinal inputs to single cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus have suggested that there is a large degree of fuzziness/variability in the information each neuron receives from the retina (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib37">Hammer et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib57">Liang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib67">Morgan et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib74">Rompani et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib77">Roson et al., 2019</a>). Here, we demonstrate that in the superior colliculus a high degree of regularity exists if one considers the projection targets. This data suggests there are strict limits on the degree of mixing of retinal ganglion cell inputs that occurs in the superior colliculus, where each output pathway has access to a distinct, only partially overlapping, set of visual information encoded by the retina. The observed regularity could exist either because the superior colliculus has a more ‘hard-wired’ architecture; or because we focused on projection-specific disynaptic circuits. When considering the layer-specific targets of the lateral geniculate nucleus in the visual cortex, Cruz-Martin et al. suggest that direction-selective neurons are preferentially sampled by layer one projecting neurons of the thalamus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib14">Cruz-Martín et al., 2014</a>). We propose that understanding the specific input structure to neurons and cell types with different projection profiles will greatly enhance our ability to create mechanistic models of how information from the sensory periphery informs the triggering of behaviors and decision making.</div><h1 data-label="840422" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h2 data-label="681601" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h1 data-label="599442" class="ltx_title_section">CHAPTER2: Characterization of GABAergic Neurons in the Mouse Superior Colliculus</h1><div></div><h1 data-label="895421" class="ltx_title_section">CHAPTER3: Characterization of Visual Information to Wide-filed Neurons in the Mouse Superior Colliculus&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-label="246690" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="246690" class="ltx_title_section">GENERAL METHOD</h1><h2 data-label="103957" class="ltx_title_subsection">1.

PvalbCre</i>&nbsp;mice (JAX: 008069) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib39">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</a>) express Cre recombinase in parvalbumin-expressing neurons.&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209Cre</i>&nbsp;mice (Genset: 030780-UCD) express Cre recombinase in&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209</i>-expressing neurons.&nbsp;<i>Gad2Cre</i>&nbsp;mice (JAX: 010802) express Cre recombinase in&nbsp;<i>Gad2</i>-expressing neurons. Ai9 (JAX: 007909) is a tdTomato reporter mouse line (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib61">Madisen et al., 2010</a>). Animals were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle, and fed with sterilized food, water, bedding and nesting material. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with standard ethical guidelines of KU Leuven and European Communities Guidelines on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (004–2014/EEC, 240–2013/EEC, 252–2015/EEC).</div><div></div><div>Rabies virus production</div><div><a href="https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap50697?item=s4-2-1">Request a detailed protocol</a></div><div>Rabies production method was similar to previously published methods (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib71">Osakada and Callaway, 2013</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib101">Yonehara et al., 2013</a>). Glycoprotein G-coated, G-deleted B19 rabies virus (G-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV) was amplified in B7GG cells, which express rabies glycoprotein G. For amplification, approximately 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;infectious units of G-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV were used to infect five 10 cm plates of 80% confluent B7GG cells followed by 2–6 hr of incubation. Then, infected B7GG cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin (Thermo, 25300054) and split into twenty-five 10 cm plates. To harvest the virus, we collected the supernatant of the infected cells every 3 days. 5–6 harvests were performed. To concentrate the virus, the supernatant was firstly centrifuged at 2500 RPM and filtered (VWR, 514–0027) to get rid of the cell debris. Then the virus was spun in an ultracentrifuge for 5–12 hr at 25,000 RPM and at 4°C. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was dissolved in 200 µl of the original cell culture supernatant. The virus was tittered by counting a culture of infected BHK cells. To produce EnvA-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV, approximately 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;infectious units of G-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV were used to infect BHK-EnvA cells. The same procedure as for the G-coated RV amplification was then applied. EnvA-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV was tittered by infection of HEK293T-TVA cells. The titer used for injection ranged from 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;to 10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;infectious units/ml (IU/ml).</div>
