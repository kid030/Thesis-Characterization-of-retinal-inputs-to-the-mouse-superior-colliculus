<div>1.3&nbsp;Central projection of the retinal ganglion cells</div><div>The retinorecipient areas contain more than 40 different brain structures, each of which receives direct input from RGCs (Morin &amp; Studholme 2014). The retinofugal pathways can be separated based on their functional distinction, into two general categories: non-image-forming versus image-forming pathways. The non-image-forming pathways include circuits that govern the core physical function of the whole-animal, such as&nbsp;the entrainment of the circadian rhythm and control the light-driven involuntary reflexive behaviors, such as the pupillary light reflex (PLR) and eye movements that ensure image stabilization. In contrast, image-forming pathways are responsible for encoding complex visual features (motion direction, contrast, color, and locations)&nbsp; and involve conscious perception.&nbsp;</div><div>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes the circadian clock in the bain. It synchronizes the&nbsp;endogenous rhythm to a 24-hour cycle and is coupled to the ambient light-dark cycle. The SCN receives predominately input from M1 and M2 ipRGCs, and they appear to innervate distinct subregions of SCN. M1 ipRGCs that lack the transcription factor Brn3b target the SCN, whereas Brn3b+ 1 ipRGCs target the shell of the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), which is a critical hub in the central PLR pathway. Specifically killing the OPN-projecting M1 Brn3b+ neurons resulted in an abrogated PLR (Chen et al 201). There are also other non-M1 ipRGCs projecting to the core of OPN, but their contributions to PLR remain to be determined. The optokinetic reflex (OKR) and the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR)&nbsp; system work in concert over both slow and fast movement to elicit the compensatory eye movements necessary to gaze stabilization.&nbsp; Direction selective RGCs and their targeted brainstem targets of the accessory optic system (AOS), namely optic tract (NOT) and the dorsal and medial of the terminal nuclei (DTN and MTN), has been implicated in&nbsp;driving the OKR.&nbsp;In detail, both On-DSGCs and ooDSGCs encoding forward motion project to the NOT and DTN and are involved in generating horizontal reflexive eye movement. The dorsal and ventral MTN receive input from On-DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion, respectively, and drive vertical  eye movement.&nbsp; (Figurexx)</div><h1 data-label="377348" class="ltx_title_section">The mouse superior colliculus </h1><h2 data-label="833619" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="833619" class="ltx_title_subsection">Organization of the superior colliculus</h2><div>The organization of the mouse SC has been characterized along multiple dimensions. First, the SC is a multisensory integration structure. It  can be divided based on its input sources with superficial&nbsp;(dorsal) layers  being visual and deeper (ventral) layers being multimodal and motor-related (May 2006, Stein 1984). The superficial layers of the SC are the major retino-recipient structure in the brain and can be further divided into several synaptic layers. Stratum zonale (SZ)&nbsp;is&nbsp;a thin, neuronal cell-sparse layer, immediately under the pial surface. Below the SZ is&nbsp;stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), or the superficial gray layer, where most RGC axons arborize. Below the SGS is the stratum opticum (SO), or the optic layers, where RGC axons enter the SC. The SO is mostly made up of retinal afferent fibers, it contains scattered neurons as well. The superficial layers of the SC also receive input from the striate and extratriate visual cortex (Wang &amp; Burkhalter 2013). The deeper layers of the SC consist of stratum griseum intermedium (SGI) and below. These layers have multiple sources of innervation, such as inputs from the somatosensory cortex (S1), auditory cortex and trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, as well as visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Second, each of these modalities is topographical mapped and aligned with the others, which allows the SC to initiate behavioral responses to multimodal stimuli (Cang &amp; Feldheim 2013).&nbsp;Retinal inputs to the superficial layers of the SC are mapped topographically such that SGS and SO neurons represent the two-dimensional visual field along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes of the SC (Fig. 1A). The somatosensory and auditory inputs are organized into topographic maps that are aligned with the visual maps, such that neurons in the same vertical column have corresponding receptive field locations, either in visual and auditory space or on the body surface (Drager &amp; Hubel 1975, Stein 1984). These sensory maps are also aligned with motor maps in the deep layers of the SC that encode the direction and amplitude of saccadic eye and head movement (Sparks et al. 1990, Wurtz &amp; Albano 1980).&nbsp;Besides, the cortical inputs that terminate in the lower SGC and deeper layers are also topographically organized aligned in register with retinal inputs (Triplett et al 2009) (Fig. 1B).&nbsp; The alignment of these maps enables the SC to integrate visual, auditory, and tactile information and to initiate orienting movements to redirect attention toward salient stimuli.</div>
