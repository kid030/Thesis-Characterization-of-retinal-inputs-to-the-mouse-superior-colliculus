<h2 data-label="604408" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>1.3 Central projection  areas receive independent and diverse visual features</div><div>The retinorecipient areas contain more than 40 different  brain structures, each of which receives direct input from different types of retinal ganglion cells  (Morin &amp; Studholme 2014) (Figxxx). The retinofugal pathways  can be separated based on their functional distinction, into two general  categories: non-image-forming versus image-forming pathways. The  non-image-forming pathways include circuits that govern the core physical  function of the whole-animal, such as&nbsp;the entrainment of the circadian  rhythm and control the light-driven involuntary reflexive behaviors, such as  the pupillary light reflex (PLR) and eye movements that ensure image  stabilization. In contrast, image-forming pathways are responsible for encoding  complex visual features (motion direction, contrast, color, and  locations)&nbsp; and involve conscious perception.&nbsp;</div><div><b><i>Non-image-forming  pathways</i></b></div><div>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes the circadian  clock in the bain. It synchronizes the&nbsp;endogenous rhythm to a 24-hour  cycle and is coupled to the ambient light-dark cycle. The SCN receives  predominately input from M1 and M2 ipRGCs, and they appear to innervate  distinct subregions of SCN. M1 ipRGCs that lack the transcription factor Brn3b  target the SCN, whereas Brn3b+ 1 ipRGCs target the shell of the olivary  pretectal nucleus (OPN), which is a critical hub in the central PLR pathway.  Specifically killing the OPN-projecting M1 Brn3b+ neurons resulted in an  abrogated PLR (Chen et al 201). There are also other non-M1 ipRGCs projecting to  the core of OPN, but their contributions to PLR remain to be determined. The  optokinetic reflex (OKR) and the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR)&nbsp; system work  in concert over both slow and fast movement to elicit the compensatory eye  movements necessary to gaze stabilization.&nbsp; Direction selective RGCs and  their targeted brainstem targets of the accessory optic system (AOS), namely  optic tract (NOT) and the dorsal and medial of the terminal nuclei (DTN and  MTN), has been implicated in&nbsp;driving the OKR.&nbsp;In detail, both  On-DSGCs and ooDSGCs encoding forward motion project to the NOT and DTN and are  involved in generating horizontal reflexive eye movement. The dorsal and  ventral MTN receive input from On-DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion,  respectively, and drive vertical eye movement.&nbsp; (Figurexx)</div><div><b><i>Image-forming  pathways</i></b></div>
