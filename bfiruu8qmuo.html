<div>To estimate the number of cell types innervating the colliculo-pulvinar and colliculo-parabigeminal circuits, we assigned our morphological data to one of the 47 putative retinal ganglion cell types documented in the Eyewire museum (<a href="http://museum.eyewire.org/">http://museum.eyewire.org</a>) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). In addition we took into consideration information about genetically identified cell types including M2, sustained OFF-alpha cells, high-definition (HD)1, HD2, vertical OS cells and the four FOXP2+&nbsp;cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib46">Jacoby and Schwartz, 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib70">Nath and Schwartz, 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib69">Nath and Schwartz, 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib78">Rousso et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib88">Sümbül et al., 2014a</a>). The first step in our decision process was to find the most likely set of potential corresponding types based on stratification peak (above, below or between the ChAT bands) and, if available, molecular information (136/658 ganglion cells; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;109 were SMI32+; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;7 were CART+; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;20 were FOXP2+). Second, the potential set of matching types was refined using a quantitative comparison of dendritic stratification profiles (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). Subsequently, we assigned each cell to its most likely cell type within the stratification based on quantifiable characteristics of the dendritic tree, as well as the shape and size of the soma (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods for details). Finally, each cell was visually inspected to control for classification errors. Of the 47 cell types in the Eyewire museum, we were unable to reliably distinguish between a set of four pairs of cell types (1ni/1no, 4i/4on, 5ti/51 and 8n/9n), as well as the subtypes of direction-selective cells (ON-OFF: 37c,37d,37r,37v; ON: 7id,7ir,7iv,7o). This resulted in 37 possible cell types to which a ganglion cell could be assigned (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). Using this process, 599 of the 658 cells were assigned to one of 37 classes.</div><div>This analysis revealed that 14 of the 37 classes of retinal ganglion cells contained at least 1% of the ganglion cells from our data set, suggesting that a limited set of retinal ganglion cell types are sampled by the colliculo-pulvinar and colliculo-parabigeminal circuits (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</a>). These 14 putative cell types contain 550 out of the 599 classified cells and will subsequently be referred to as clusters 1–14, where the corresponding cluster in electron microscopy data of&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al. (2018)</a>&nbsp;is referred to as EM C-xx (e.g. cluster&nbsp;1 is EM C-1wt.&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</div><div>For each cell type, we tested if there was a bias in the proportion of cells innervating one of the two circuits, quantified using a selectivity index (where 0 indicates equal sampling, and 1 or −1 indicate unique sampling by either the pulvinar or parabigeminal nucleus, respectively). A bootstrapping analysis was used to estimate confidence intervals and, together with a two-proportion z-test, determine if this selectivity measurement was different from 0 (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). Eight cell types showed a strong bias for innervating one of the colliculo-parabigeminal or colliculo-pulvinar circuits (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>; bootstrap and two proportion z-test p&lt;0.05). We found that clusters 3, 4, 7 and 13 preferentially innervated the colliculo-parabigeminal (cluster 3 p=0.0322 |&nbsp;0.0221; cluster 4 p=0.0009 | 10−5; cluster 7 p=0.0483 |&nbsp;0.0358; cluster 13 p=0.0009 | 10−9, bootstrap analysis | two-proportion z-test), and clusters 2, 5, 10 and 11 preferentially innervate the colliculo-pulvinar circuit (cluster 2 p=0.0009 |&nbsp;0.0001; cluster 5 p=0.0217 |&nbsp;0.0001; cluster 10 p=0.0483 |&nbsp;0.0001; cluster 11 p=0.0241 |&nbsp;0.0299, bootstrap analysis | two-proportion z-test). The remaining six cell types (cluster 1, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 14) were found to innervate both circuits more evenly (cluster 1 p=0.9933 |&nbsp;0.9794; cluster 6 p=0.3717 |&nbsp;0.0513; cluster 8 p=0.5350 |&nbsp;0.2452; cluster 9 p=0.6640 |&nbsp;0.4568; cluster 12 p=0.9933 |&nbsp;0.9731; cluster 14 p=0.8462 |&nbsp;0.7091, bootstrap analysis | two-proportion z-test).</div><div>The cell types preferentially innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit include two bistratified cell types, clusters 3 and 4. Cluster 4 (EM C-37) consists of the CART+, ON-OFF direction-selective cells. Little is known about cluster 3 (EM C-27), apart from their sluggish ON-responses to moving bar stimuli (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). In addition, the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit receives specific input from cluster 7 (EM C-5to), whose members have large dendritic trees (median diameter: 229 µm) that stratify between the ChAT-bands and exhibit weak ON and stronger OFF-responses to a moving bar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). The fourth specific cell type is the SMI32+, sustained ON-alpha cells of cluster 13 (EM C-8w).</div><div>The cell types preferentially innervating the colliculo-pulvinar circuit include clusters 2, 5, 10 and 11. Cluster 2 (EM C-2an) and 5 (EM C-4i/4on) consist of small OFF-cells (median diameter: 139 and 185 µm). The FOXP2+&nbsp;Fmini-OFF cells in cluster 2 (EM C-2an) stratify just above the ChAT-band, while the cells in cluster 5 (EM C-4i/4on) have their dendrites between the ChAT-bands. In addition, this circuit receives inputs from two ON-cell types (cluster 10 and 11). Both, the small cells of cluster 10 (EM C-6sn) and the SMI32+, transient ON-alpha cells of cluster 11 (EM C-6sw) stratify above the ON-ChAT-band.</div><div>The two circuits share non-biased inputs from six cell types, clusters 1, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 14. These contain the two SMI32+, OFF-alpha types, sustained OFF-alpha (cluster 1, EM C-1wt) and transient OFF-alpha (cluster 6, EM C-4ow). Further, they are innervated by the FOXP2+&nbsp;ON-cells, the Fmini-ON in cluster 9 (EM C-63) and the Fmidi-ON in cluster 12 (EM C-6t). The medium sized cells (median diameter: 191 µm) in cluster 8 (EM C-5si) stratify between the ChAT-bands and are potentially HD1 or HD2 cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib46">Jacoby and Schwartz, 2017</a>). The final cluster 14 (EM C-8n/9n) consists of an ON-cell type that stratifies below the ChAT-bands.</div>
