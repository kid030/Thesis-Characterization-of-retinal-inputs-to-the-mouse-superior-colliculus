<h2 data-label="866778" class="ltx_title_subsection">3.5 Functional properties of retinal ganglion cells support anatomical classification</h2><div>To determine if the functional response properties of cells within a cluster are consistent, we performed two-photon targeted patch-clamp recordings from transsynaptically labeled neurons (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig4">Figure 4</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>). We presented each neuron with a set of visual stimuli that included the ‘chirp’ stimulus and a moving bar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>). For a subset of 48 of the recorded cells, we were able to retrieve the anatomy after recording. These cells are part of the data set that was assigned to anatomical cell types (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>). In order to test if cells in a given anatomical cluster have consistent light responses, we used the ‘chirp’ stimulus which can be used to distinguish between different ganglion cell types (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib48">Jouty et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib77">Roson et al., 2019</a>). For each of the clusters containing at least one of the 48 both traced and patched cells, we calculated the average response to the ‘chirp’ stimulus and used it as a template (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). We then assigned each of the remaining retrogradely labeled patched retinal ganglion cells without anatomical data (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;75) to one of the anatomical clusters based on the similarity between the average response of the neuron and the templates, using three distance metrics (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). A cell was assigned to a cluster if at least two distance measurements ranked the cluster in the top two, if the distance measurements did not agree with each other, the cluster with the highest linear correlation coefficient was taken (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods).</div><div>To determine if the functional response properties of cells within a cluster are consistent, we performed two-photon targeted patch-clamp recordings from transsynaptically labeled neurons (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig4">Figure 4</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>).
