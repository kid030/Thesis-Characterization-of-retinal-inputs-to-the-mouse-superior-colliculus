<div>In the superior colliculus, at least 5 distinct cell types: wide-field cell, horizontal cells, narrow-field cell, stellate cells and ....have been identified. They differ in the morphological properties, preferred visual stimuli and gene expression. In addition, they also differ in the target structures to which they project, suggesting that the features they detect are important for different behaviors.&nbsp;</div>
