After 5-10 days of rabies injection, retinas were isolated from mice that were dark-adapted for a minimum of 30 mintues. Retina isolation was done under deep red illumination in Ringer's medium (110mM NaCl, 2.5mM KCL, 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.6mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM D-glucose, 22mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, bubbled wiht 5% CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>/ 95% O<sub>2</sub>, PH 7.4 ). The retinas were then mounted gangllion cell-side up on filter paper (Millipore, HAWP01300) THAT HAD A 3.5mm - wide rectangular aperture in the center, and superfused with Ringer's medium at 32-35&nbsp;â„ƒ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="100564" class="ltx_title_subsection">Patch recordings</h2><h2 data-label="421664" class="ltx_title_subsection">Two-photon recordings</h2><h2 data-label="417121" class="ltx_title_subsection">Light stimulation</h2><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="942511" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div></div><div></div>
