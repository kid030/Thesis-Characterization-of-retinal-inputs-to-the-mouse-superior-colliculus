After 5-10 days of rabies injection, retinas were isolated from mice that were dark-adapted for a minimum of 30 minutes. Retina isolation was done under deep red illumination in Ringer's medium (110mM NaCl, 2.5mM KCL, 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.6mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM D-glucose, 22mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>/ 95% O<sub>2</sub>, PH 7.4 ). The retinas were then mounted ganglion cell-side up on filter paper (Millipore, HAWP01300) THAT HAD A 3.5mm - wide rectangular aperture in the center and superfused with Ringer's medium at 32-35&nbsp;â„ƒ in the microscope chamber for the duration of the experiment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="440908" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Patch recordings</h3><h3 data-label="680419" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Two-photon recordings</h3><h3 data-label="263422" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Presentation of Visual Stimuli</h3><div>Stimuli were generated with an LCD projector (Samsung, SP F10M) at a refresh rate of 60Hz, controlled with custom software wirtten&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="942511" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div></div><div></div>
