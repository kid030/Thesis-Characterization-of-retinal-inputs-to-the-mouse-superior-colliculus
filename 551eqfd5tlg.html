<div>Taken together, the anatomical, physiological and molecular results indicate that different output pathways of the superior colliculus sample distinct sets of retinal inputs, where some inputs are biased towards a single pathway and others shared. We therefore asked if we could explain any of the response properties in the collicular targets by their preferential or shared sampling of ganglion cells.</div>
