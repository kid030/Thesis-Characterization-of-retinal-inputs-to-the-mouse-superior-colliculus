<div>Taken together, the anatomical, physiological and molecular results indicate that different output pathways of the superior colliculus sample distinct sets of retinal inputs, where some inputs are biased towards a single pathway and others shared. We therefore asked if we could explain any of the response properties in the collicular targets by their preferential or shared sampling of ganglion cells.</div><div>To characterize the visual response properties of neurons in the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus, we performed single-unit recordings using Neuropixels high-density multichannel silicon probes (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib49">Jun et al., 2017</a>) in awake, head-fixed mice (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). In each recording session, stereotaxic coordinates were used to target the parabigeminal nucleus or pulvinar. The recording locations were verified by histological reconstruction of the electrode tracts (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6B–C</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). In the pulvinar, we only included recordings from its posterior portion, which receives input from the superior colliculus and does not respond well to full-field stimuli (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib6">Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib8">Bennett et al., 2019</a>). We recorded the brain activity on 384 electrodes spanning&nbsp;~3800 µm in depth during visual stimulation (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6D and E</a>) and extracted the spikes from single units (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6F</a>). The receptive field centers of the recorded neurons were between −35° and +35° elevation and −65° and +25° azimuth.</div><div>We found that neurons in both the posterior pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus responded reliably to a set of visual stimuli (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6G</a>) that includes: a large fast moving square (‘big-fast’, 53° side length, 150°/s); a small, fast moving spot (‘small-fast’, 4° diameter, 150°/s) and expanding discs (expanding from 2° to 50° of diameter within 300 ms). However, the percentages of responding units (maximal response&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;mean spontaneous firing rate + two std) differed for the different stimuli between the parabigeminal nucleus and the pulvinar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6F</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). Both responded to small, slow stimuli (diameter&nbsp;=&nbsp;4°, speed&nbsp;=&nbsp;21°/s) and expanding discs, however, more parabigeminal neurons responded to fast stimuli (150°/s) while the number of neurons responding to large, slow (size&nbsp;=&nbsp;53°, speed&nbsp;=&nbsp;21°/s) and dimming objects was larger in the pulvinar.</div>
