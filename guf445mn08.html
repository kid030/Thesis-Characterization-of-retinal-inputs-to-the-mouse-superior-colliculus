After 5-10 days of rabies injection, retinas were isolated from mice that were dark-adapted for a minimum of 30 minutes. Retina isolation was done under deep red illumination in Ringer's medium (110mM NaCl, 2.5mM KCL, 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.6mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM D-glucose, 22mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>/ 95% O<sub>2</sub>, PH 7.4 ). The retinas were then mounted ganglion cell-side up on filter paper (Millipore, HAWP01300) THAT HAD A 3.5mm - wide rectangular aperture in the center and superfused with Ringer's medium at 32-35&nbsp;â„ƒ in the microscope chamber for the duration of the experiment.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="440908" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="440908" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Patch Pecordings</h3><h3 data-label="680419" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="680419" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Two-photon Recordings</h3><h3 data-label="263422" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="263422" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Presentation of Visual Stimuli</h3><div>Stimuli were generated with an LCD projector (Samsung, SP F10M) at a refresh rate of 60Hz, controlled with custom software written in Octave based on Psychtoobox. </div><div></div><div>The light path contained two motorized filter wheels. One wheel contained a set of natural density (ND) filters (Thorlabs NE10B-A to NE50B-A), with optical densities from 1 (ND1) to 5 (ND5), that were used to control the stimulus intensity in logarithmic steps. Another wheel contained a set of filters, that were used to achieve defined transmission properties.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Recordings were performed with filters decreasing the stimulus intensity by 1-2 log units.

The power produced by the projector was 240 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at the retina. The output of the projector ranges from black (0) to white (255) pixels. All stimuli were gray-scale images with pixel values between 0 (black) and 255 (white). The background was kept at 30 (gray). The stimuli were balanced so that the mean intensity over time equaled background.
