<div>The range of intensities the retina can operate at covers about 10<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>by using two classes of photoreceptors, namely the rods and the cones. The corresponding broad categories of light intensity are called scotopic (only rods are active, starlight vision), mesopic (both rods and cones are active), and photopic (rods are saturated, and only cones are active, daylight vision). Rods and cones convet their signals through specialized circuits, eventially converging onto r</div>
