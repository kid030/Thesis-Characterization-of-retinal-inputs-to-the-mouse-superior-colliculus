<div>The range of intensities the retina can operate at covers about 10<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>by using two classes of photoreceptors, namely the rods and the cones. The corresponding broad categories of light intensity are called scotopic (only rods are active, starlight vision), mesopic (both rods and cones are active), and photopic (rods are saturated, and only cones are active, daylight vision). Rods and cones convet their signals through specialized circuits, eventially converging onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. There are more than 40 different functional types, each of them transmitting information to the brain about ta certain subset of features of the image stream impinging onto the photoreceptors. The specific response pattern of each ganglion cell type is largely shaped by the connectivity with the presynaptic circuitry and the precise Spatio-temporal interactions of all cells involved (bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells). Sophisticated response patterns produced by retinal ganglion cells include direction-selective response, approach-sensitive response, object-specific motion sensitivity, or color specificity.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="249070" class="ltx_title_subsection">Superior Colliculus</h2><div>Superior colliculus (SC) is an integrative sensorimotor structure that receives inputs from multi-sensory modalities. </div><h3 data-label="943828" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="943828" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">SC structure and its inputs and outputs</h3><div>SC is organized into several synaptic layers, each of which as distinct sources of innervation.

Deep layers of the SC also contain premotor neurons that control rapid eye movements known as saccades. </div><div></div>
