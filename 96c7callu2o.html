<div>One key difference between the parabigeminal nucleus and pulvinar is their response to directional movement. We found strong and reliable responses of neurons in the parabigeminal nucleus to the presentation of a fast&nbsp;moving black square (53° side length, moving at 150°/s) moving in eight directions (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6G</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). Only very few pulvinar neurons responded to this stimulus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6G</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>); however, the response amplitude and duration of responding neurons were similar for both nuclei (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). A large fraction of parabigeminal neurons showed a preference for one or two directions of motion (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6I and K</a>). This direction-selectivity was not present in pulvinar neurons (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6J and K</a>; p&lt;0.05 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing the DSI distributions for the two nuclei). On the other hand, one key similarity between the two brain regions was their responses to a biologically relevant stimulus consisting of a black expanding disc (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6L–M</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). Neurons in both the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus responded during the expansion phase of this stimulus, and there was no difference in the distribution of response strengths between the two populations of neurons (p&gt;0.05 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6L–M</a>).</div>
