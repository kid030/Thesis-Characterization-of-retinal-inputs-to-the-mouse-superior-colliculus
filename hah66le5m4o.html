<h2 data-label="858639" class="ltx_title_subsection">2.4 Visually guided behaviors mediated by the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h2><div>The  SC has been suggested to be involved in the innate behaviors in other species from early studies. For example, wild rats with colliculus lesions showed a decreased responsiveness to visual stimuli and reduced flight behavior. Stimulating the SC by injecting the GABA antagonist could evoke freezing, escape, or jumping in rats. Recently, more efforts have been made on finding the neuronal pathways in the SC that mediate visually guided innate behaviors. Yilmaz and Meister for the first time showed an overhead looming stimulus that mimics an arterial predator efficiently triggers fleeing-to-nest or freezing responses in mice (Yilmaz and Meister 2013). SC has been proved to be a critical node in mediating the innate behaviors from&nbsp;a series of papers published since then. Zhao et al (2014) firstly reported that SC neurons respond to looming stimuli. In the next year, Wei et al (2015) identified a&nbsp;subpopulation of excitatory neurons located at the medial part of the superior colliculus that travels through the lateral posterior nucleus (also known as lateral pulvinar, LP) targeting the amygdala responded to and mediated a freezing response to a looming stimulus.&nbsp;Due to great effort at people made on the identification&nbsp;of the cell types in the colliculus, technique development of specific virus labeling and optogenetic progress, cell-type specific pathways in the SC have been investigated.&nbsp;Shang et al (2015) found a subpopulation PV<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>collicuar neurons targeting Pbg that transmits further to the amygdala triggered freezing and escape responses.  Wide-field neurons exclusively target LP, which fact leads us to believe that the collicular excitatory neurons targeting LP that induce freezing behavior (Wei et al 2014) are the wide-field neurons (Fig. 3). In addition, cortico-collicular input also plays a role in inducing or modulating defensive behaviors. One research team by applying a flashing light, induced a transient suspended locomotion behavior and found a top-down pathway from L5 neurons in the visual cortex to superior colliculus is involved in this arrest behavior (Liang et al., 2015). Recently, the SC has also been proved to contribute to the prey capture behavior (Hoy et al 2016). This behavior has also been seen in other species (Finlay et al 1980, Ewert 1974, Semmelhack et al 2014).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><b>3. Objectives (research aims of the  PhD)</b></div><div>Several  decades ago, the pioneer work from Lettvin and his colleagues using frog as a model,  has shown that the retinal ganglion cells inform the brain about distinct  visual features (Lettvin et al 1959). The visual information were further  parsed within the neuronal circuits and eventually trigger different behavioral  responses. However, how the visual information is parsed in the brain and how the  neuronal circuit are wired to generate different types of behavior are not  clear yet. </div><div>To explore  this question, I looked at the mouse visual system, which has been positioned as  a key model in the field of vision, which enables the specific target of the  neuronal circuit by using transgenetic and viral tools. Besides, a significant  amount of work has been done to test the behavioral responses. &nbsp;</div><div>One well-known  retinofugal circuit that generate the pupillary light reflexive behaviors start  from ipRGCs, more specifically M1 ipRGCs expressing the transcription factor  Brn3b. The visual information is sent to the shell of OPN, which further target  Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and then ciliary ganglion to drive the pupil constriction.  It raised the possibility that certain visual features are parsed in dedicated visual  pathways and are connected to steryotyeped behaviors. In 2013, Yilmaz &amp;  Meister used an expanding dark disc shown atop an animal, reliably trigger the  freezing or escaping behavior. However,&nbsp;  a light expanding disk or an expanding disck presented below the animal  has no impact on freezing or flight, indicating that the specificity of the  stimulus are highly linked to defined behavior-related circuitry. </div><div>To test the  hypothesis, during my PhD, I cauterized the retinal ganglion cells that innervate  in two different brain circuits via the superior colliculus, which are known to  be involved in triggering the mice innate behaviors. Comparing the retinal ganglion  cell types from these two circuits will enable me to know if they sample  different or the same visual information and consequently know whether  differentvisual inputs give rise to the different behaviors. </div>
