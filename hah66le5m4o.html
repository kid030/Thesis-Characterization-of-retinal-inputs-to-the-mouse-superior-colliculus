<h3 data-label="927497" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Visually guided behaviors mediated by the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h3><div>The  SC has been suggested to be involved in the innate behaviors in other species from early studies. For example, wild rats with colliculus lesions showed a decreased responsiveness to visual stimuli and reduced flight behavior. Stimulating the SC by injecting the GABA antagonist could evoke freezing, escape, or jumping in rats. Recently, more efforts have been made on finding the neuronal pathways in the SC that mediate visually guided innate behaviors. Yilmaz and Meister for the first time showed an overhead looming stimulus that mimics an arterial predator efficiently triggers fleeing-to-nest or freezing responses in mice (Yilmaz and Meister 2013).&nbsp;Later on,&nbsp; people found the superior colliculus is a critical node in mediating the innate behaviors.&nbsp;</div>
