For example, wild rats with colliculus lesions showed a decreased responsiveness to visual stimuli and reduced flight behavior.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>The mouse superior colliculus receives direct inputs from retina and routes this information to distinct downstream projection areas to control diverse innate behaviors.&nbsp;</div>
