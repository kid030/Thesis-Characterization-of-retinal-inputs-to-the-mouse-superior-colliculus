<h3 data-label="927497" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Visually guided behaviors mediated by the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h3><div>The  SC has been suggested to be involved in the innate behaviors in other species from early studies. For example, wild rats with colliculus lesions showed a decreased responsiveness to visual stimuli and reduced flight behavior. Stimulating the SC by injecting the GABA antagonist could evoke freezing, escape, or jumping in rats. Recently, more efforts have been made on finding the neuronal pathways in the SC that mediate visually guided innate behaviors. Yilmaz and Meister for the first time showed an overhead looming stimulus that mimics an arterial predator efficiently triggers fleeing-to-nest or freezing responses in mice (Yilmaz and Meister 2013). In 2014, Zhao et al (2)Later on,&nbsp; people found the superior colliculus is a critical node in mediating the innate behaviors.&nbsp; Wei et al identified a&nbsp;subpopulation of excitatory neurons in the superior colliculus that travels through the lateral posterior nucleus (also known as lateral pulvinar, LP) targeting the amygdala responded to and mediated a freezing response to a looming stimulus.&nbsp;Another research team by applying a flashing light, induced a transient suspended locomotion behavior and found a top-down pathway from L5 neurons in the visual cortex to superior colliculus is involved in this arrest behavior (Liang et al., 2015). However, the neuronal circuit via the superior colliculus mediating the behaviors is not known. With the identification&nbsp;of the cell types in the colliculus, development of specific virus labeling and optogenetic progress, several pathways via different superior colliculus neuronal celly types have been investigated.&nbsp;Shang et al found a subpopulation of collicular neurons that are PV positive targeting Pbg that transmits further to the amygdala triggered freezing and escape responses (Shang et al 2015).  Wide-field neurons exclusively target LP, which fact leads us to believe that the collicular excitatory neurons targeting LP that induce freezing behavior are the wide-field neurons</div>
