<h3 data-label="927497" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Visually guided behaviors mediated by the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h3><div>The  SC has been suggested to be involved in the innate behaviors in other species from early studies. For example, wild rats with colliculus lesions showed a decreased responsiveness to visual stimuli and reduced flight behavior. Stimulating the SC by injecting the GABA antagonist could evoke freezing, escape, or jumping in rats. Recently, more efforts have been made on finding the neuronal pathways in the SC that mediate visually guided innate behaviors. Yilmaz and Meister for the first time showed an overhead looming stimulus that mimics an arterial predator efficiently triggers fleeing-to-nest or freezing responses in mice (Yilmaz and Meister 2013). SC has been proved to be a critical node in mediating the innate behaviors from&nbsp;a series of papers published since then. Zhao et al (2014) firstly reported that SC neurons respond to looming stimuli. In the next year, Wei et al (2015) identified a&nbsp;subpopulation of excitatory neurons located at the medial part of the superior colliculus that travels through the lateral posterior nucleus (also known as lateral pulvinar, LP) targeting the amygdala responded to and mediated a freezing response to a looming stimulus.&nbsp;Another research team by applying a flashing light, induced a transient suspended locomotion behavior and found a top-down pathway from L5 neurons in the visual cortex to superior colliculus is involved in this arrest behavior (Liang et al., 2015). Due to great effort at people made in  identification&nbsp;of the cell types in the colliculus, technique development of specific virus labeling and optogenetic progress, cell-type specific pathways in the SC have been investigated.&nbsp;Shang et al (2015) found a subpopulation PV<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>collicuar neurons targeting Pbg that transmits further to the amygdala triggered freezing and escape responses.  Wide-field neurons exclusively target LP, which fact leads us to believe that the collicular excitatory neurons targeting LP that induce freezing behavior (Wei et al 2014) are the wide-field neurons (Fig. 3).
