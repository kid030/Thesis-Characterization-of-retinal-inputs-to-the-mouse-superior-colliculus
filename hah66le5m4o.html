<h2 data-label="858639" class="ltx_title_subsection">2.4 Visually guided behaviors mediated by the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h2><div>The  SC has been suggested to be involved in the innate behaviors in other species from early studies. For example, wild rats with colliculus lesions showed a decreased responsiveness to visual stimuli and reduced flight behavior. Stimulating the SC by injecting the GABA antagonist could evoke freezing, escape, or jumping in rats. Recently, more efforts have been made on finding the neuronal pathways in the SC that mediate visually guided innate behaviors. Yilmaz and Meister for the first time showed an overhead looming stimulus that mimics an arterial predator efficiently triggers fleeing-to-nest or freezing responses in mice (Yilmaz and Meister 2013). SC has been proved to be a critical node in mediating the innate behaviors from&nbsp;a series of papers published since then. Zhao et al (2014) firstly reported that SC neurons respond to looming stimuli. In the next year, Wei et al (2015) identified a&nbsp;subpopulation of excitatory neurons located at the medial part of the superior colliculus that travels through the lateral posterior nucleus (also known as lateral pulvinar, LP) targeting the amygdala responded to and mediated a freezing response to a looming stimulus.&nbsp;Due to great effort at people made on the identification&nbsp;of the cell types in the colliculus, technique development of specific virus labeling and optogenetic progress, cell-type specific pathways in the SC have been investigated.&nbsp;Shang et al (2015) found a subpopulation PV<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>collicuar neurons targeting Pbg that transmits further to the amygdala triggered freezing and escape responses.  Wide-field neurons exclusively target LP, which fact leads us to believe that the collicular excitatory neurons targeting LP that induce freezing behavior (Wei et al 2014) are the wide-field neurons (Fig. 3). In addition, cortico-collicular input also plays&nbsp; a role in inducing or modulating defensive behaviors. One research team by applying a flashing light, induced a transient suspended locomotion behavior and found a top-down pathway from L5 neurons in the visual cortex to superior colliculus is involved in this arrest behavior (Liang et al., 2015). Recently, the SC has also been proved to contribute to the prey capture behavior (Hoy et al 2016). This behavior has also been seen in other species (Finlay et al 1980, Ewert 1974, Semmelhack et al 2014).&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="632331" class="ltx_title_subsection">3.

The rules by which parallel inputs are routed to downstream targets are poorly understood. The superior colliculus mediates a set of innate behaviors, receiving input from &gt;30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviorally important targets including the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus. Combining transsynaptic circuit tracing with in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, we observed a projection-specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. Neurons projecting to the pulvinar or the parabigeminal nucleus showed strongly biased sampling from four cell types each, while six others innervated both pathways. The visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells correlated well with those of their disynaptic targets. These findings open the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus.</div><h2 data-label="448443" class="ltx_title_subsection">Introduction</h2><div>The nervous system nervous system is built built from a large set large set of diverse neuronal cell diverse neuronal cell types that work together work together to process process information and generate behavior generate behavior (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib104">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</a>).
