<div>To stain the retina for FOXP2, we used a slightly different staining procedure. After fixation and freeze-cracking, retinas were washed three times for 10 min each in 1x PBS, followed by incubation with blocking buffer (5% NDS, 0.3% TritonX-100 in 1x PBS) overnight at 4°C. Primary antibody against FOXP2 (abcam1307, 1:2000) was added after blocking and retinas were incubated for 5–7 days under constant gentle shaking at 4°C. They were prepared in 5% NDS, 0.3% TritonX-100 in 1x PBS. After incubation, retinas were washed three times for 15 min in 1x PBS with 0.3% TritonX-100 before being transferred into the secondary antibody solution (Alexa555 donkey anti-goat abcam150130, 1:300); prepared in 1xPBS overnight at 4°C. The second day, retinas were washed three times in 1x PBS and incubated in the second primary antibody solution for 5–7 days under constant gentle shaking at room temperature. The second primary antibodies were rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, A-11122, 1:500) and goat anti-ChAT (Chemicon, Ab144P, 1:200), which were prepared in 3% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS. After incubation, retinas were washed three times for 10 min in 1x PBS with 0.5% TritonX-100 before being transferred into the secondary antibody solution (Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A21206, 1:500) and Alexa633 donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen A-21082, 1:500); prepared in 3% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS. Retinas were then washed three times in 1x PBS with 0.5% TritonX-100 and once in 1x PBS. Mounting procedures are the same as listed above.</div><div><b>Brain immunohistochemistry</b></div><div>After removing the eyes, mice were immediately perfused with 1x PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Vibratome sections (100–200 µm) were collected in 1x PBS and were incubated in blocking buffer (1x PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 10% Donkey serum) at room temperature for 1 hr. Then slices were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The next day, slices were washed three times for 10 min each in 1x PBS with 0.3% TritonX-100 and incubated in secondary antibody solution diluted in blocking buffer for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-GFP (Thermo Fisher, A-11122, 1:500) and chicken anti-mCherry (Novus, NBP2-25158, 1:1000) and secondary antibodies used were Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher, A21206, 1:500–1000) and Cy3 donkey anti-chicken (ImmunoJackson, 703-166-155, 1:800–1000). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Roche, 10236276001, 1:500) together with the secondary antibody solution. Sections were then again washed three times for 10 min in 1x PBS with 0.3% TritonX-100 and once in 1x PBS, covered with mounting medium (Dako, C0563) and a glass coverslip. For the Pbg experiments, we applied Nissl stain instead of the DAPI stain, where the Pbg can be identified as a cell-dense area. Nissl stain was applied after the secondary antibody staining. After washing with 1x PBS, the brain slices were incubated with Nissl in 1x PBS (NeuronTrace 435/455, Thermo, N21479, 1:150) for at least 20 min at room temperature. Afterwards, the sections were rinsed for 10 min in 1x PBS with 0.1% TritonX-100, followed by another two times washing for 5 min each in 1x PBS. Finally, the sections were washed on a shaker for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in 1x PBS<b>.</b></div><div><b>Confocal microscopy</b></div><div>Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 microscope. Overview images of the retina and brain were obtained with a 10x (plan-APOCHROMAT 0.45 NA, Zeiss) objective. The following settings were used: zoom 0.7, 4 × 4 tiles with 0% to 15% overlap, 2.37 µm/pixel resolution. For single retina ganglion cell scanning, we used a 63x (plan-APOCHROMAT 1.4 NA, Zeiss) objective. The following settings were used: zoom 0.7, 2 × 2 tiles or more (depending on size and number of cells) with 0% to 15% overlap. This resulted in an XY-resolution of 0.38 µm/pixel and a Z-resolution between 0.25 and 0.35 µm/pixel. The Z-stacks covered approximately 50 µm in depth.</div><h3>In&nbsp;vivo electrophysiology</h3>
