<div>To stain the retina for FOXP2, we used a slightly different staining procedure. After fixation and freeze-cracking, retinas were washed three times for 10 min each in 1x PBS, followed by incubation with blocking buffer (5% NDS, 0.3% TritonX-100 in 1x PBS) overnight at 4°C. Primary antibody against FOXP2 (abcam1307, 1:2000) was added after blocking and retinas were incubated for 5–7 days under constant gentle shaking at 4°C. They were prepared in 5% NDS, 0.3% TritonX-100 in 1x PBS. After incubation, retinas were washed three times for 15 min in 1x PBS with 0.3% TritonX-100 before being transferred into the secondary antibody solution (Alexa555 donkey anti-goat abcam150130, 1:300); prepared in 1xPBS overnight at 4°C. The second day, retinas were washed three times in 1x PBS and incubated in the second primary antibody solution for 5–7 days under constant gentle shaking at room temperature. The second primary antibodies were rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, A-11122, 1:500) and goat anti-ChAT (Chemicon, Ab144P, 1:200), which were prepared in 3% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS. After incubation, retinas were washed three times for 10 min in 1x PBS with 0.5% TritonX-100 before being transferred into the secondary antibody solution (Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A21206, 1:500) and Alexa633 donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen A-21082, 1:500); prepared in 3% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS. Retinas were then washed three times in 1x PBS with 0.5% TritonX-100 and once in 1x PBS. Mounting procedures are the same as listed above.</div><div><b>Brain immunohistochemistry</b></div>
