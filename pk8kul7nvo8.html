<div>To determine the wiring rules underlying the integration of retinal information by different output pathways of the superior colliculus, we used a combination of transsynaptic viral tracing and molecular markers to specifically label the retinal ganglion cells at the beginning of two circuits: one targeting the parabigeminal nucleus (colliculo-parabigeminal circuit) and the second targeting the pulvinar (colliculo-pulvinar circuit). These two circuits were chosen as they are each directly involved in mediating orienting behaviors and are not major recipients of direct retinal input (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib84">Shang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib83">Shang et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib98">Wei et al., 2015</a>). Using quantitative analysis of the retinal ganglion cell morphology and comparison of the visual response properties in the retina and target nuclei, we found strong specificity in the routing of visual information through the superior colliculus.</div><h2 data-label="886153" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="886153" class="ltx_title_subsection">Results</h2><h2 data-label="219035" class="ltx_title_subsection">Transsynaptic tracing of retinal ganglion cells from targets of the superior colliculus</h2><div>To determine if visual features are selectively sampled by two targeted output pathways of the mouse superior colliculus, we used rabies-based viral tools to label retinal ganglion cells innervating either the colliculo-parabigeminal or colliculo-pulvinar circuit. Three properties of the labeled ganglion cells were characterized. First, we reconstructed each cell’s anatomy, with a particular focus on quantifying its dendritic depth profile within the retina. If available, this was combined with information about each cell’s molecular identity based on labeling by different antibodies, and subsequently matched to cell types within the database of the Eyewire Museum (<a href="http://museum.eyewire.org/">http://museum.eyewire.org</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). Finally, the visual response properties of a subset of labeled neurons were measured.</div><div>To perform these experiments, we injected the parabigeminal nucleus or lateral pulvinar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s2">2</a>) with herpes-simplex virus (HSV) expressing rabies-G, TVA and mCherry, and subsequently injected EnvA-coated rabies virus coding for GCaMP6s (EnvA-SADΔG-GCaMP6s) into the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). This transsynaptic viral infection strategy resulted in the expression of GCaMP6s in several dozen retinal ganglion cells per retina that specifically innervate the targeted circuit. To infect neurons projecting to the lateral pulvinar we utilized a floxed version of the HSV virus (hEF1a-LS1L-TVA950-T2A-RabiesG-IRES-mCherry) in combination with the&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209Cre</i>&nbsp;mouse line, which ensured labeling of wide-field neurons of the superior colliculus that project to the lateral pulvinar and not adjacent thalamic nuclei (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib33">Gale and Murphy, 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib31">Gale and Murphy, 2014</a>).</div><h2 data-label="720115" class="ltx_title_subsection">Anatomy of retinal inputs to the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuits</h2><div>The morphology of 658 ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;241) and colliculo-pulvinar (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;417) circuit were extracted.

A semi-automated image processing routine was applied to high-resolution confocal image stacks of each ganglion cell that enables a precise quantification of their dendritic morphology (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib88">Sümbül et al., 2014a</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib89">Sümbül et al., 2014b</a>). The cells showed a variety of morphologies:~7% had bistratified dendritic trees (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;49), either co-stratifying with the ChAT-bands, or stratifying outside the ChAT bands (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1D</a>);~17% were mono-stratified with dendrites below the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;110);~50% had their dendrites restricted to the region between the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;326); and&nbsp;~26% had dendrites stratifying exclusively above the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;173;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1</a>). We calculated for each cell the area covered by the dendrites and created a depth profile of the dendritic tree (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). Our data set contains cells with dendritic field diameters ranging from 57 to 468 µm (median: 194 µm), similar to the reported range of 80 to 530 µm (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib3">Badea and Nathans, 2004</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib12">Coombs et al., 2006</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib53">Kong et al., 2005</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib90">Sun et al., 2002</a>).</div><div>Comparing the size and stratification of retinal ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuits revealed two basic trends. First, cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit had larger dendritic trees (median: 279 μm) than the cells innervating the colliculo-pulvinar circuit (median: 190 μm; p&lt;0.01, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon rank sum test;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1E</a>). This was true at each stratification level (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1F</a>). Second, the stratification depth of cells innervating each circuit had distinct distributions. While the colliculo-pulvinar circuit showed strong bias for sampling from neurons stratifying between (55.6%) and above (29.3%) the ChAT-bands, the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit sampled more evenly from each stratification level (bistratified 14.5%, below ChAT-bands 25.3%, between 39.0%, above 21.2%;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1G</a>). We found that these differences are not due to a bias in the retinotopic location of the sampled cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>).</div><div></div><h2 data-label="623494" class="ltx_title_subsection">Biased sampling of retinal ganglion cell types by the colliculo-parabigeminal and the colliculo-pulvinar circuit</h2>
