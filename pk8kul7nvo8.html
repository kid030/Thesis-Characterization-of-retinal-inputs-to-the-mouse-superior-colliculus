<div>To determine the wiring rules underlying the integration of retinal information by different output pathways of the superior colliculus, we used a combination of transsynaptic viral tracing and molecular markers to specifically label the retinal ganglion cells at the beginning of two circuits: one targeting the parabigeminal nucleus (colliculo-parabigeminal circuit) and the second targeting the pulvinar (colliculo-pulvinar circuit). These two circuits were chosen as they are each directly involved in mediating orienting behaviors and are not major recipients of direct retinal input (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib84">Shang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib83">Shang et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib98">Wei et al., 2015</a>). Using quantitative analysis of the retinal ganglion cell morphology and comparison of the visual response properties in the retina and target nuclei, we found strong specificity in the routing of visual information through the superior colliculus.</div><h2 data-label="886153" class="ltx_title_subsection">Results</h2><h3 data-label="946447" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Transsynaptic tracing of retinal ganglion cells from targets of the superior colliculus</h3>
