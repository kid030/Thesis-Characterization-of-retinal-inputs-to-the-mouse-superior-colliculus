<div>To determine the wiring rules underlying the integration of retinal information by different output pathways of the superior colliculus, we used a combination of transsynaptic viral tracing and molecular markers to specifically label the retinal ganglion cells at the beginning of two circuits: one targeting the parabigeminal nucleus (colliculo-parabigeminal circuit) and the second targeting the pulvinar (colliculo-pulvinar circuit). These two circuits were chosen as they are each directly involved in mediating orienting behaviors and are not major recipients of direct retinal input (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib84">Shang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib83">Shang et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib98">Wei et al., 2015</a>). Using quantitative analysis of the retinal ganglion cell morphology and comparison of the visual response properties in the retina and target nuclei, we found strong specificity in the routing of visual information through the superior colliculus.</div><h2 data-label="886153" class="ltx_title_subsection">Results</h2><h2 data-label="219035" class="ltx_title_subsection">Transsynaptic tracing of retinal ganglion cells from targets of the superior colliculus</h2><div>To determine if visual features are selectively sampled by two targeted output pathways of the mouse superior colliculus, we used rabies-based viral tools to label retinal ganglion cells innervating either the colliculo-parabigeminal or colliculo-pulvinar circuit. Three properties of the labeled ganglion cells were characterized. First, we reconstructed each cell’s anatomy, with a particular focus on quantifying its dendritic depth profile within the retina. If available, this was combined with information about each cell’s molecular identity based on labeling by different antibodies, and subsequently matched to cell types within the database of the Eyewire Museum (<a href="http://museum.eyewire.org/">http://museum.eyewire.org</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). Finally, the visual response properties of a subset of labeled neurons were measured.</div><div>To perform these experiments, we injected the parabigeminal nucleus or lateral pulvinar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s2">2</a>) with herpes-simplex virus (HSV) expressing rabies-G, TVA and mCherry, and subsequently injected EnvA-coated rabies virus coding for GCaMP6s (EnvA-SADΔG-GCaMP6s) into the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). This transsynaptic viral infection strategy resulted in the expression of GCaMP6s in several dozen retinal ganglion cells per retina that specifically innervate the targeted circuit. To infect neurons projecting to the lateral pulvinar we utilized a floxed version of the HSV virus (hEF1a-LS1L-TVA950-T2A-RabiesG-IRES-mCherry) in combination with the&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209Cre</i>&nbsp;mouse line, which ensured labeling of wide-field neurons of the superior colliculus that project to the lateral pulvinar and not adjacent thalamic nuclei (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib33">Gale and Murphy, 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib31">Gale and Murphy, 2014</a>).</div><h2 data-label="720115" class="ltx_title_subsection">Anatomy of retinal inputs to the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuits</h2><div>The morphology of 658 ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;241) and colliculo-pulvinar (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;417) circuit were extracted.

A semi-automated image processing routine was applied to high-resolution confocal image stacks of each ganglion cell that enables a precise quantification of their dendritic morphology (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib88">Sümbül et al., 2014a</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib89">Sümbül et al., 2014b</a>). The cells showed a variety of morphologies:~7% had bistratified dendritic trees (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;49), either co-stratifying with the ChAT-bands, or stratifying outside the ChAT bands (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1D</a>);~17% were mono-stratified with dendrites below the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;110);~50% had their dendrites restricted to the region between the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;326); and&nbsp;~26% had dendrites stratifying exclusively above the ChAT-bands (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;173;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1</a>). We calculated for each cell the area covered by the dendrites and created a depth profile of the dendritic tree (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). Our data set contains cells with dendritic field diameters ranging from 57 to 468 µm (median: 194 µm), similar to the reported range of 80 to 530 µm (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib3">Badea and Nathans, 2004</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib12">Coombs et al., 2006</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib53">Kong et al., 2005</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib90">Sun et al., 2002</a>).</div><div>Comparing the size and stratification of retinal ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuits revealed two basic trends. First, cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit had larger dendritic trees (median: 279 μm) than the cells innervating the colliculo-pulvinar circuit (median: 190 μm; p&lt;0.01, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon rank sum test;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1E</a>). This was true at each stratification level (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1F</a>). Second, the stratification depth of cells innervating each circuit had distinct distributions. While the colliculo-pulvinar circuit showed strong bias for sampling from neurons stratifying between (55.6%) and above (29.3%) the ChAT-bands, the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit sampled more evenly from each stratification level (bistratified 14.5%, below ChAT-bands 25.3%, between 39.0%, above 21.2%;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1G</a>). We found that these differences are not due to a bias in the retinotopic location of the sampled cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>).</div><h2 data-label="623494" class="ltx_title_subsection">Biased sampling of retinal ganglion cell types by the colliculo-parabigeminal and the colliculo-pulvinar circuit</h2><div>To estimate the number of cell types innervating the colliculo-pulvinar and colliculo-parabigeminal circuits, we assigned our morphological data to one of the 47 putative retinal ganglion cell types documented in the Eyewire museum (<a href="http://museum.eyewire.org/">http://museum.eyewire.org</a>) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). In addition we took into consideration information about genetically identified cell types including M2, sustained OFF-alpha cells, high-definition (HD)1, HD2, vertical OS cells and the four FOXP2+&nbsp;cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib46">Jacoby and Schwartz, 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib70">Nath and Schwartz, 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib69">Nath and Schwartz, 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib78">Rousso et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib88">Sümbül et al., 2014a</a>). The first step in our decision process was to find the most likely set of potential corresponding types based on stratification peak (above, below or between the ChAT bands) and, if available, molecular information (136/658 ganglion cells; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;109 were SMI32+; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;7 were CART+; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;20 were FOXP2+). Second, the potential set of matching types was refined using a quantitative comparison of dendritic stratification profiles (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). Subsequently, we assigned each cell to its most likely cell type within the stratification based on quantifiable characteristics of the dendritic tree, as well as the shape and size of the soma (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods for details). Finally, each cell was visually inspected to control for classification errors. Of the 47 cell types in the Eyewire museum, we were unable to reliably distinguish between a set of four pairs of cell types (1ni/1no, 4i/4on, 5ti/51 and 8n/9n), as well as the subtypes of direction-selective cells (ON-OFF: 37c,37d,37r,37v; ON: 7id,7ir,7iv,7o). This resulted in 37 possible cell types to which a ganglion cell could be assigned (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). Using this process, 599 of the 658 cells were assigned to one of 37 classes.</div><div>This analysis revealed that 14 of the 37 classes of retinal ganglion cells contained at least 1% of the ganglion cells from our data set, suggesting that a limited set of retinal ganglion cell types are sampled by the colliculo-pulvinar and colliculo-parabigeminal circuits (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</a>). These 14 putative cell types contain 550 out of the 599 classified cells and will subsequently be referred to as clusters 1–14, where the corresponding cluster in electron microscopy data of&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al. (2018)</a>&nbsp;is referred to as EM C-xx (e.g. cluster&nbsp;1 is EM C-1wt.&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</div><div>For each cell type, we tested if there was a bias in the proportion of cells innervating one of the two circuits, quantified using a selectivity index (where 0 indicates equal sampling, and 1 or −1 indicate unique sampling by either the pulvinar or parabigeminal nucleus, respectively). A bootstrapping analysis was used to estimate confidence intervals and, together with a two-proportion z-test, determine if this selectivity measurement was different from 0 (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). Eight cell types showed a strong bias for innervating one of the colliculo-parabigeminal or colliculo-pulvinar circuits (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>; bootstrap and two proportion z-test p&lt;0.05). We found that clusters 3, 4, 7 and 13 preferentially innervated the colliculo-parabigeminal (cluster 3 p=0.0322 |&nbsp;0.0221; cluster 4 p=0.0009 | 10−5; cluster 7 p=0.0483 |&nbsp;0.0358; cluster 13 p=0.0009 | 10−9, bootstrap analysis | two-proportion z-test), and clusters 2, 5, 10 and 11 preferentially innervate the colliculo-pulvinar circuit (cluster 2 p=0.0009 |&nbsp;0.0001; cluster 5 p=0.0217 |&nbsp;0.0001; cluster 10 p=0.0483 |&nbsp;0.0001; cluster 11 p=0.0241 |&nbsp;0.0299, bootstrap analysis | two-proportion z-test). The remaining six cell types (cluster 1, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 14) were found to innervate both circuits more evenly (cluster 1 p=0.9933 |&nbsp;0.9794; cluster 6 p=0.3717 |&nbsp;0.0513; cluster 8 p=0.5350 |&nbsp;0.2452; cluster 9 p=0.6640 |&nbsp;0.4568; cluster 12 p=0.9933 |&nbsp;0.9731; cluster 14 p=0.8462 |&nbsp;0.7091, bootstrap analysis | two-proportion z-test).</div><div>The cell types preferentially innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit include two bistratified cell types, clusters 3 and 4. Cluster 4 (EM C-37) consists of the CART+, ON-OFF direction-selective cells. Little is known about cluster 3 (EM C-27), apart from their sluggish ON-responses to moving bar stimuli (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). In addition, the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit receives specific input from cluster 7 (EM C-5to), whose members have large dendritic trees (median diameter: 229 µm) that stratify between the ChAT-bands and exhibit weak ON and stronger OFF-responses to a moving bar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). The fourth specific cell type is the SMI32+, sustained ON-alpha cells of cluster 13 (EM C-8w).</div><div>The cell types preferentially innervating the colliculo-pulvinar circuit include clusters 2, 5, 10 and 11. Cluster 2 (EM C-2an) and 5 (EM C-4i/4on) consist of small OFF-cells (median diameter: 139 and 185 µm). The FOXP2+&nbsp;Fmini-OFF cells in cluster 2 (EM C-2an) stratify just above the ChAT-band, while the cells in cluster 5 (EM C-4i/4on) have their dendrites between the ChAT-bands. In addition, this circuit receives inputs from two ON-cell types (cluster 10 and 11). Both, the small cells of cluster 10 (EM C-6sn) and the SMI32+, transient ON-alpha cells of cluster 11 (EM C-6sw) stratify above the ON-ChAT-band.</div><div>The two circuits share non-biased inputs from six cell types, clusters 1, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 14. These contain the two SMI32+, OFF-alpha types, sustained OFF-alpha (cluster 1, EM C-1wt) and transient OFF-alpha (cluster 6, EM C-4ow). Further, they are innervated by the FOXP2+&nbsp;ON-cells, the Fmini-ON in cluster 9 (EM C-63) and the Fmidi-ON in cluster 12 (EM C-6t). The medium sized cells (median diameter: 191 µm) in cluster 8 (EM C-5si) stratify between the ChAT-bands and are potentially HD1 or HD2 cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib46">Jacoby and Schwartz, 2017</a>). The final cluster 14 (EM C-8n/9n) consists of an ON-cell type that stratifies below the ChAT-bands.</div>
