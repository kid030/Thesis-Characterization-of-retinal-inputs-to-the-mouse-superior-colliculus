<div data-label="200608">Overview of the cell types in superficial layers of the SC (Gale and Murphy, 2014 &amp;&nbsp; 2018;&nbsp;Claudio et al 2018, Shang et al 2018, Kyle et al 2019 ).&nbsp; (A) From top to bottom are the example morphologies of the distinct cell types, the relative transgenetic mouse linee and their brain targets. Arrowhead and circles indicate excitatory or inhibititory synapses, respectively. (B) Summary of the approximate proportions of GABAergic cell in PV-Cre mouse line (left) and the relationship between PV<sup>+&nbsp;</sup>cells and GABA<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;cells. Note</div>
