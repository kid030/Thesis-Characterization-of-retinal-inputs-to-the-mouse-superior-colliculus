<div>To label the pulvinar circuit, we performed the surgery on&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209Cre</i>&nbsp;mice and injected a conditional HSV (hEF1a-LS1L-TVA950-T2A-RabiesG-IRES-mCherry, MIT viral core, RN716) and EnvA-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV. The injections into pulvinar and superior colliculus were the same as described for the parabigeminal nucleus. The injection coordinates for the pulvinar in a 4 weeks old mouse with a bregma-lambda distance of 4.7 mm were AP: −1.85; ML:±1.50; DV: 2.50 mm.</div>
