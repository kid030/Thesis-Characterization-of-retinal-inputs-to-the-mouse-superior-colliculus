<div><b>Retinal electrophysiologyPreparation of retinas</b></div><div>For in&nbsp;vitro recordings of retinal ganglion cells, we used mice that had been injected with herpes-simplex virus into the Pbg or pulvinar and rabies virus into the superior colliculus to label circuit specific retinal ganglion cells as described above. For pulvinar experiments, we analyzed 64 cells from 20&nbsp;<i>Ntsr-Cre</i>&nbsp;mice. For Pbg-specific ganglion cells, we recorded 50 cells in retinas from&nbsp;<i>PV-Cre</i>&nbsp;(N&nbsp;=&nbsp;14) or&nbsp;<i>Gad2-Cre</i>&nbsp;(N&nbsp;=&nbsp;3) mice. Retinas were isolated from mice that were dark-adapted for a minimum of 30 min. Retina isolation was done under deep red illumination in Ringer’s medium (110 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, 22 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4). The retinas were then mounted ganglion cell-side up on filter paper (Millipore, HAWP01300) that had a 3.5 mm wide rectangular aperture in the center, and superfused with Ringer’s medium at 32–36°C in the microscope chamber for the duration of the experiment.</div><div><b>Electrophysiology</b></div><div>Electrophysiological recordings were made using an Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and borosilicate glass electrodes (BF100-50-10, Sutter Instrument). Signals were digitized at 20 kHz (National Instruments) and acquired using WaverSurfer software (version: 0.918) written in MATLAB. The spiking responses were recorded using the patch clamp technique in loose cell-attached mode with electrodes pulled to 3–5 MΩ resistance and filled with Ringer’s medium. To visualize the pipette, Alexa 555 was added to the Ringer’s medium.</div><div><b>Targeted recordings using two-photon microscopy</b></div><div>Fluorescent cells were targeted for recording using a two-photon microscope (Scientifica) equipped with a Mai Tai HP two-photon laser (Spectra Physics) integrated into the electrophysiological setup. To facilitate targeting, two-photon fluorescent images were overlaid with the IR image acquired through a CCD camera. Infrared light was produced using the light from an LED. For some cells, z-stacks were acquired using ScanImage (Vidrio Technologies).</div><div><b>Presentation of visual stimuli</b></div><div>Stimuli were generated with an LCD projector (Samsung, SP F10M) at a refresh rate of 60 Hz, controlled with custom software written in Octave based on Psychtoolbox. The projector produced a light spectrum that ranged from&nbsp;~&nbsp;430 nm to&nbsp;~&nbsp;670 nm. The power produced by the projector was 240 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;at the retina. Neutral density filters were used to control the stimulus intensity in logarithmic steps. Recordings were performed with filters decreasing the stimulus intensity by 1–2 log units. The following visual stimuli were used for retinal recordings:</div><div><i>Full-field ‘chirp’ modulation</i></div><div>A full-field stimulus based on the ‘chirp’ stimulus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>) starting with slow transitions gray-black-gray-white-gray (3 s at each level), followed by a temporal modulation between black and white starting at 0.5 Hz and increasing to 8 Hz over a time of 6 s. After 3 s at a gray screen, the contrast was modulated from 0% to 100% over a time period of 5.5 s at 2 Hz. The stimulus was repeated 10 times.</div><div><i>Spot-size</i></div><div>A black or white spot of 6 sizes (4°, 8°, 12°, 16°, 20°, 40°) was shown for 2 s at the center of the gray screen. Both the colors and the sizes were shown in random sequence.</div><div><i>Large moving bar</i></div><div>A black bar with a width of 40° moved with a speed of 150°/sec across the screen in eight directions (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°). Each direction was repeated 5 times. The directions were randomized.</div><div><i>Expansion</i></div><div>A black disc linearly expanded from 2° to 50° of diameter within 300 ms (150°/sec) at the center of the screen. The stimulus was repeated 10 times.</div><div><i>Dimming</i></div><div><a href="https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap50697?item=s4-4-4-5">Request a detailed protocol</a></div><div>A disc of 50° diameter linearly dimmed from background gray to black within 300 ms (150°/sec) at the center of the screen. The stimulus was repeated 10 times.</div><div><i>Looming objects</i></div><div><a href="https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap50697?item=s4-4-4-6">Request a detailed protocol</a></div><div>A small disc non-linearly expanded from 2° to 50° of diameter at a slow (18.5°/sec), medium (92°/sec) and fast speed (150°/sec). Each condition was repeated 10 times.</div><div><i>Slow-small objects</i></div><div><a href="https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap50697?item=s4-4-4-7">Request a detailed protocol</a></div><div>A black disc of 4° diameter moved with 21°/sec in two direction (left-right, right-left) at the center line across the screen. Each direction was repeated 5 times.</div><div><i>Morphology of patched cells</i></div><div><a href="https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap50697?item=s4-4-5">Request a detailed protocol</a></div><div>After patching, retinas were fixed and stained as described above. If the rabies labelling density allowed it, the morphology of the patched cells was imaged using a confocal microscope.</div>
