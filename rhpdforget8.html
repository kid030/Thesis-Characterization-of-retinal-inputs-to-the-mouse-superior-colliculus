They found SC neurons respond best to a small, slowly moving object of any shape within the receptive-field and a subset of SC neurons are direction-selective to the moving stimuli. In later research, Wang et al (2010) conducted&nbsp;a quantitative and thorough analysis of visual response properties of the SC neurons in anesthetized mice.&nbsp;</div><div>They found that most  SC neurons respond to both onset and offset of the  flashing spot with the preferred radius of 6-10°, similar to their receptive field size. Besides, they also detailed how individual SC neurons are tuned to direction and orientation selectivity, spatial and temporal frequency, and response linerity. It is noted that, the direction selectivity has been observed across several species including pri</div><div></div><div></div><h3>Behavioural output of the superior colliculus</h3>
