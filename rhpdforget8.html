<div>Firstly, contralateral RGCs along the temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina  project  along the anterior-posterior (A-P) of the SC. The dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC.&nbsp; Additionally, ipsilateral RGCs and V1 exons terminate in a slightly deeper SGS lamina and are retinotopically aligned with the contralateral rtinocollcilular map.&nbsp; (Figure.1)</div>
