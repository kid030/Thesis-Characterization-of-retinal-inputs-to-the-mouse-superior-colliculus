They found SC neurons respond best to a small, slowly moving object of any shape within the receptive-field and a subset of SC neruons are direction-slective to the moving stimuli. In later research, Zhang et al conducted&nbsp;a quantitative and thorough analysis of visual response properties of the Sin anesthetized mice (Zhang et al, 2010). They revealed the&nbsp;ON/OFF responses to flashing spot, and detailed how individual SC neruons are tuned to direction and orientation selectivity, spatial and temporal frequency, and response linerity.</div><div></div><div></div><h3>Behavioural output of the superior colliculus</h3>
