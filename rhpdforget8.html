They found SC neurons respond best to a small, slowly moving object of any shape within the receptive-field and a subset of SC neurons are direction-selective to the moving stimuli. In later research, Wang et al (2010) conducted&nbsp;a quantitative analysis of visual response properties using single-unit extracellular recordings from superficial layers of the SC in anesthetized mice. They found that most  SC neurons respond to both onset and offset of the  flashing spot with the preferred radius of 6-10°, similar to their receptive field size. Besides, they also detailed how individual SC neurons are tuned to direction and orientation selectivity, spatial and temporal frequency, and response linerity. Around 30% of cells displayed high direction-selective responses (DSI≥0.5) and ~20% of cells displayed high orientation-selective responses (OSI≥0.5, DSI&lt;0.5). It is also noted that the direction-selectivity has been observed across several species including primates (Albano et al. 1978, Cynader &amp; Berman 1972, Fortin et al. 1999, Masland et al. 1971, McIlwain &amp; Buser 1968, Michael 1972, Rhoades &amp; Chalupa 1976), which conservation is suggestive of a specialized function of the SC in visual processing. A recent report from de Malmazet et al (2018) using two-photon calcium imaging showed  a retinotopic separation of both nasally and temporally tuned direction selctive neurons in the mouse SC. This separation resembles an optic flow field map, which is&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3>Behavioural output of the superior colliculus</h3>
