They found SC neurons respond best to a small, slowly moving object of any shape within the receptive-field and a subset of SC neruons are direction-slective to the moving stimuli. Later, a quantitative and thorough analysis of visual response properties of superfical SC neruons were conducted in anesthetized mice (Zhang et al, 2010).
