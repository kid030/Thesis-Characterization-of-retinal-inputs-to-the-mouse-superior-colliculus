They found SC neurons respond best to a small, slowly moving object of any shape within the receptive-field and a subset of SC neurons are direction-selective to the moving stimuli. In later research, Wang et al (2010) conducted&nbsp;a quantitative and thorough analysis of visual response properties of the SC neurons in anesthetized mice (Zhang et al, 2010).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>They revealed the&nbsp;ON/OFF responses of individual SC neurons using flashing spot, and detailed how individual SC neurons are tuned to direction and orientation selectivity, spatial and temporal frequency, and response linerity.</div><div></div><div></div><h3>Behavioural output of the superior colliculus</h3>
