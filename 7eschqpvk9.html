<div></div><h2>Retina development&nbsp;</h2><h2>Luminance level</h2><div>The range of intensities the retina can operate at covers about 10<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>by using two classes of photoreceptors, namely the rods and the cones. The corresponding broad categories of light intensity are called scotopic (only rods are active, starlight vision), mesopic (both rods and cones are active), and photopic (rods are saturated, and only cones are active, daylight vision). Rods and cones convet their signals through specialized circuits, eventially converging onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. There are more than 40 different functional types, each of them transmitting information to the brain about ta certain subset of features of the image stream impinging onto the photoreceptors. The specific response pattern of each ganglion cell type is largely shaped by the connectivity with the presynaptic circuitry and the precise Spatio-temporal interactions of all cells involved (bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells). Sophisticated response patterns produced by retinal ganglion cells include direction-selective response, approach-sensitive response, object-specific motion sensitivity, or color specificity.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="249070" class="ltx_title_subsection">Superior Colliculus</h2><h3 data-label="726803" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"> SC Structure and Organization</h3><div>Superior colliculus (SC) is an integrative sensorimotor structure that receives inputs from multi-sensory modalities. It is organized into several synaptic layers:&nbsp; the stratum zonale (SZ), a thin layer located just below the pial surface; the stratum griseum superficialis (SGS) where most RGC axons arborize, and which can itself be further divided into upper (uSGS) and lower (lSGS) sublayers; the stratum opticum (SO); deeper SC, which can be further subdivided into stratum griseum intermidiaum (SGI) and below (dSC). </div><div>There are three key features of SC organization, which are conserved among different species. First,  along the superficial to the deep axis with the superficial layers being visual, which receives around&nbsp;85-90% retinal inputs&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ellis_2016}</cite> and deeper layers multimodal and premotor. Second, each of these layers has distinct sources of innervation, each of the SC layers as distinct sources of innervation. Within the SGC,&nbsp; different RGC types also project to different sublaminar.&nbsp;The SCS received direct inputs from contralateral retinal ganglion cells (RGC). For example, on-off direction-selective (ooDS) cells project to the upper uSGC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2010}</cite>, alpha ganglion cells project to the lSGS (ref). lSGC also receives ipsilateral retinal inputs from the primary and extrastriate visual cortex. The deeper SC receives sensory inputs from multiple modalities, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the auditory nuclei of the midbrain, the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, and visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex. Deep layers of the SC  contain premotor neurons that control rapid eye movements known as saccades (???).&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;individual SC layers contain topographic maps of the sensory periphery or motor commands, and these maps are in register across layers. The alignment of these maps allows the SC to integrate multisensory information and to initiate orienting movements toward salient stimuli. Retinal inputs to the superficial layer are mapped topographically with respect to the visual field. Temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina projects along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the SC, and the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC. Retinal inputs from contralateral and ipsilateral eys, and V1, and other sensory inputs are all topographically organized&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Triplett_2009,Triplett_2012}</cite>. This organization enables neurons from different sensory modalities that monitor the same position of the environment terminate in the register but in distinct laminar.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="469397" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">&nbsp;Distinct colliclular cell types</h3><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="366801"></h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="366801">Background knowledge</h2><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection" data-label="383814">Different mouse model </h3><div>Cnga3 <sup>-/-</sup>, rod-only retina with non-functional cones.&nbsp;</div><div>Rho<sup>-/-</sup>, cone-only retina with non-functional rods.&nbsp;</div><div>Opna4<sup>-/-</sup>,&nbsp;melanopsin lacking retina.</div><div>PV-Cre:The PV-Cre knockin allele has the endogenous parvalbumin (<i>Pvalb</i>) promoter/enhancer elements&nbsp; directing Cre recombinase expression to&nbsp;<i>Pvalb</i>-expressing cells.
