<h2 data-label="792768" class="ltx_title_subsection">4. Discussion</h2><div>Comparing the morphological, molecular and visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar pathways passing through the superior colliculus has led to three conclusions (Figure 8). First, the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuit together sample from a limited set (14 of 37) of retinal ganglion cell types (Bae et al., 2018). Second, there is a clear preference in the set of retinal ganglion cell types providing input to each circuit. While four putative ganglion cell types show a strong preference for the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit, and four others for the colliculo-pulvinar circuit, six other types are more equally sampled by both circuits. Third, some response properties of neurons in downstream targets can be</div><div>explained by the different and shared sampling biases of each retinal ganglion cell type by each col-</div><div>licular output pathway, respectively. These results support the notion that, in the superior colliculus,</div><div>neural circuits are based on a dedicated set of connections between specific retinal inputs and differ-</div><div>ent collicular output pathways</div>
