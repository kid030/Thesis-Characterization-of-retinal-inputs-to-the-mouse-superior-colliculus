<h2 data-label="792768" class="ltx_title_subsection">4. Discussion</h2><div>Comparing the morphological, molecular and visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar pathways passing through the superior colliculus has led to three conclusions (Figure 8). First, the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuit together sample from a limited set (14 of 37) of retinal ganglion cell types (Bae et al., 2018). Second, there is a clear preference in the set of retinal ganglion cell types providing input to each circuit. While four putative ganglion cell types show a strong preference for the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit, and four others for the colliculo-pulvinar circuit, six other types are more equally sampled by both circuits. Third, some response properties of neurons in downstream targets can be explained by the different and shared sampling biases of each retinal ganglion cell type by each collicular output pathway, respectively. These results support the notion that, in the superior colliculus, neural circuits are based on a dedicated set of connections between specific retinal inputs and different collicular output pathways.</div><div>Ganglion cell types innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and  colliculo-</div><div>pulvinar circuits</div><div>The identification of the ganglion cells  innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar</div><div>circuit was accomplished by finding the  best match of each ganglion cell in our data to the cell types</div><div>in the Eyewire data base using a  combination of morphological and molecular cues (Table 1). Of  the</div><div>14 clusters, 8 (clusters 1, 2, 4, 6, 9,  11, 12 and 13) include molecularly identified cells (Figures 2 and</div><div>3). Briefly, the cells in cluster 4 are ON-OFF  direction-selective cells, based on their characteristic co-</div><div>stratification with the ChAT bands and  positive CART labelling (Dhande  et al., 2013; Sanes and</div><div>Masland, 2015). The four alpha ganglion cell types (cluster 13,  sustained ON-alpha; cluster 11, tran-</div><div>sient ON-alpha; cluster 6, transient  OFF-alpha; cluster 1, sustained OFF-alpha) were positively identi-</div><div>fied based on a combination of positive  SMI32 staining, dendritic anatomy and large cell body size</div><div>(Bleckert  et al., 2014; Krieger et al., 2017), as well as their visual response properties</div><div>(Baden  et al., 2016). In addition, three out of the four  FOXP2-positive cell types were identified</div><div>(cluster 2, Fmini-OFF; cluster 9,  Fmini-ON; cluster 12, Fmidi-ON), where Fmini-OFF cells are likely</div><div>PV7 cells (Farrow et al., 2013; Rousso  et al., 2016).</div><div>For the remaining six cell types (clusters  3, 5, 7, 8 10 and 14), we manually inspected published</div><div>collections of anatomical and functional  retinal ganglion cell types (Baden  et al., 2016;</div><div>Su¨mbu¨ l et al., 2014a; Vo¨lgyi et al., 2009). These  included the small cells in cluster 8 that resemble</div><div>the HD1 or HD2 cells (Bae et al., 2018; Jacoby  and Schwartz, 2017). The large  ON-cells in cluster</div><div>14 might correspond to type G6 (Vo¨ lgyi et al., 2009), and resemble the Ka-cells (Su¨mbu¨l et al.,</div><div>2014a). Based on their size and the reported responses to a  moving bar (Bae et al., 2018), they</div><div>best fit the ON sustained (G22) or ON  local sustained (G30) type (Baden  et al., 2016). We found the</div><div>best morphological match for cluster 3 and  cluster 10 to be G16 and G8, respectively (Vo¨lgyi et al.,</div><div>2009), and the best functional match to be G26 (ON DS  sustained) and G17 (ON local transient)</div><div>(Baden  et al., 2016). Finally, the chirp response profiles of  cluster 5 and 7 best fit the chirp</div><div>responses of the mini OFF-transient cells  (G9) and OFF-slow cells (G4), respectively (Baden et al.,</div><div>2016). Although our identification of cell types is well  grounded, the relationship between anatomi-</div><div>cal data sets (Bae et al., 2018), physiological data sets (Baden et al., 2016) and molecular identity</div><div>of cell types remains incomplete (Dhande et al., 2015; Sanes and Masland, 2015).</div><div>Retrograde transsynaptic labelling of retinal ganglion cells</div><div>Transsynaptic rabies tracing using  injections of herpes-simplex virus (HSV-rabiesG-TVA-mCherry) to</div><div>target nuclei, and subsequent injection of  EnvA-coated rabies virus (EnvA-SADDG-GCaMP6s) to the</div><div>superior colliculus proved to be a  suitable tool to determine the circuit specificity of collicular projec-</div><div>ting retinal ganglion cells. First, HSV  has a strictly synaptic uptake mechanism that prevents infection</div><div>of passing axons, ensuring that we labeled  neurons that synapse within the pulvinar or parabigemi-</div><div>nal nucleus (Antinone and Smith, 2010; McGavern  and Kang, 2011). Labeling of passing axons is</div><div>an issue with other retrograde tracers (Ellis et al., 2016). Second, G-deleted rabies has been  demon-</div><div>strated to reliably label retinal ganglion  cells innervating the superior colliculus, dorsal lateral genicu-</div><div>late nucleus or medial terminal nucleus (Cruz-Martı´n et al., 2014; Ellis et al., 2016; Farrow  et al., 2013; Rompani et al., 2017; Yonehara  et al., 2013). Finally, injection of EnvA-coated  rabies virus</div><div>into the superior colliculus, without  previous injection of HSV-rabiesG-TVA-mCherry into either the</div><div>pulvinar or parabigeminal nucleus resulted  in no labeling of retinal ganglion cells in the retina or neu-</div><div>rons in the superior colliculus (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We therefore believe that this com-</div><div>bination of tools reliably and  specifically labels retinal ganglion cells innervating the different</div><div>targeted pathways of the superior  colliculus.</div><div>However, while there is no evidence  suggesting a retinal ganglion cell bias in rabies virus uptake,</div><div>the speed with which viral particles are  retrogradely transported likely varies between retinal gan-</div><div>glion cell types, due to differences in  axonal diameter and the availability of minus-end-directed</div><div>motor dynein of different cell types (Antinone and Smith, 2010). These biases are reflected in the</div><div>relatively large numbers of alpha retinal  ganglion cells we labeled as compared to the number of</div><div>small retinal ganglion cells (e.g. ON-OFF  direction-selective and FOXP2+ ganglion cells) labeled in</div><div>our individual experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</div><div>In addition, it is possible that we  underestimated the number of cell types innervating these two</div><div>circuits. This is for three reasons.  First, clusters with &lt; 1% of all cells were not considered as an</div><div>input-providing cell type here (Figure 2—source data 1). If these clusters are ‘true’ inputs, a  higher</div><div>infection rate might reveal enough cells  to be considered for further analysis. Second, we saw a large</div><div>variability in the absolute numbers of  neurons labeled in different experiments (Figure 3—figure</div><div>supplement 1). For cell types with a low probability of being  labeled they may not have been</div><div>detected reliably enough to be counted.  However, within each circuit, we measured a similar per-</div><div>centage of molecularly identified cells  independent of the total number of rabies-infected cells (Fig-</div><div>ure 3—figure supplement 1). Third, we systematically labeled more  neurons in pulvinar</div><div>experiments as compared to parabigeminal  experiments. This might be because the parabigeminal</div><div>nucleus is difficult to target due to its  small size or because the pulvinar receives more inputs from</div><div>the colliculus. Despite this fact, four  cell types (clusters 3, 4, 7 and 14) were found almost exclusively</div><div>in our parabigeminal experiments.</div><div>Given these potential biases due to  technical limitations, we have more cells from colliculo-pulvi-</div><div>nar experiments in our database than from  colliculo-parabigeminal experiments. The absolute num-</div><div>ber of cells found in a given cluster for  each circuit is a consequence of these experimental</div><div>limitations and not of the innervation  strength of this cell type. We therefore do not assess the rela-</div><div>tive input strength of the different  ganglion cell types to an individual circuit. Instead, we based our</div><div>analysis and conclusions on a comparison  of the relative distributions of individual cell types between</div><div>the two circuits, and not absolute  numbers. By comparing the relative percentage of the same cell</div><div>types between the circuits, we have  minimized this effect. We are confident that the differences in</div><div>numbers of infected cells has no major  effect on the relative distributions of cell types observed, and</div><div>the differences we see in labeling  probabilities reflect real biological differences in the wiring dia-</div><div>gram of the two circuits. To get a  complete picture of how individual neurons in each circuit are sam-</div><div>pling retinal inputs, a single cell or  sparse cell-type-specific approach is necessary (Rompani et al.,</div><div>2017; Yonehara  et al., 2013).</div><div>A second tool used to limit infecting  off-target brain nuclei during the injection of HSV was the</div><div>Ntsr1-GN209Cre mouse line (Gerfen et al., 2013). This mouse line ensured that we  exclusively</div><div>labeled wide-field neurons projecting to  the pulvinar (Gale and Murphy, 2014). This may bias our</div><div>results as it is possible that unknown  collections of other cell types also project to the pulvinar from</div><div>the superior colliculus. However, two  pieces of evidence suggest this is unlikely. First, in a screen of</div><div>different Cre-mouse lines, Ntsr1-GN209Cre  positive neurons were found to only innervate the pulvi-</div><div>nar, while other cell types were found to  not innervate the pulvinar (Gale  and Murphy, 2018;</div><div>Gale and Murphy, 2014). In addition, unbiased retrograde  labeling of collicular neurons, using HSV,</div><div>from the pulvinar has predominantly  revealed wide-field neurons, though a small number of neurons</div><div>that might be of a different type were  also seen (Zhou et al., 2017). Shang et al. (2018) report that</div><div>a subpopulation of neurons in the PV-Cre  mouse line projects to the posterior portion of the pulvi-</div><div>nar. As these pulvinar projecting PV+ neurons have a similar projection pattern and cell  body position within the superior colliculus to Ntsr1-GN209Cre neurons, we  think it likely that they are a</div><div>subpopulation of wide-field neurons.  However, while in mice only one wide-field neuronal cell type</div><div>has been described, two types of  wide-field neurons have been found in ground squirrels that have</div><div>distinct anatomies and project to  different regions within the pulvinar (Fredes et al., 2012;</div><div>Major et al., 2000). The description of cell types within  the mouse superior colliculus remains imma-</div><div>ture compared to that of mouse retinal  ganglion cell types.</div><div>Functional responses of retinal ganglion cells and target nuclei</div><div>One question we attempted to answer here  was whether we could explain the different visual</div><div>response properties of neurons in the  parabigeminal nucleus and pulvinar by their distinct retinal</div><div>inputs. While some of the differences were  indeed consistent (e.g. direction-selective neurons inner-</div><div>vate the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit  and looming sensitive neurons innervate both circuits), we</div><div>found clear differences in the visual  responses in the retina and the pulvinar and parabigeminal</div><div>nucleus. The classification of retinal  ganglion cells was based on their generally robust responses to</div><div>a full-field chirp stimulus, which fails  to evoke visual responses in either the posterior pulvinar or par-</div><div>abigeminal nucleus (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In addition, the colliculo-pulvinar  circuit</div><div>receives inputs from ganglion cells that  respond well to big and fast objects (cluster 11 and shared</div><div>inputs from cluster 1), but responses to  such stimuli were weak or absent in the pulvinar neurons.</div><div>These differences might reflect strong  non-linearities in how retinal inputs are integrated, or they</div><div>might be a result of balanced excitatory  and inhibitory inputs that cancel each other out.</div><div>These differences between visual response  properties of innervating retinal ganglion cells and</div><div>their disynaptic central targets in the  pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus is in stark contrast to what</div><div>is found in the dorsal lateral geniculate  nucleus, where many of the neurons respond well to full-field</div><div>stimulation and their visual response  properties can be understood as a linear sum of different com-</div><div>binations of putatively innervating  retinal ganglion cell types (Roson  et al., 2019). Local inhibitory</div><div>and excitatory connections within the  superior colliculus might mediate the different full-field</div><div>responses of inputs and outputs (Gale and Murphy, 2018). Indeed, while inputs from the visual  cor-</div><div>tex appear to modulate the gain of visual  responses within the superior colliculus (Shi et al., 2017;</div><div>Wang et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2014; De  Franceschi and Solomon, 2018),  removal of local inhibi-</div><div>tion in the superior colliculus reveals  masked response characteristics including responses to large,</div><div>stationary objects in pulvinar-projecting  neurons (Gale and Murphy, 2016). A more in-depth, cell-</div><div>type-specific approach is needed to  understand the functional consequences of selective wiring of</div><div>retinal ganglion cells with their targets  in the superior colliculus.</div><div>We recorded direction-selective responses  in the parabigeminal nucleus but not in the pulvinar,</div><div>which was mirrored by the selective  innervation of ON-OFF direction-selective neurons to the colli-</div><div>culo-parabigeminal pathway. However,  Fmini-ON, which innervate both circuits, and Fmini-OFF cells,</div><div>which selectively innervate the  colliculo-pulvinar circuit, have been reported to be direction-selective</div><div>(Rousso  et al., 2016). There are three reasons why this  selectivity may not make a major contribution</div><div>to direction-selective responses in the  superior colliculus and its downstream targets. First, it has</div><div>been demonstrated that direction-selective  responses in the superior colliculus rely on the inhibitory</div><div>output of starburst amacrine cells (Shi et al., 2017), where starburst amacrine cells are responsible</div><div>for the direction-selective responses of  ON-OFF and ON direction-selective ganglion cells</div><div>(Euler  et al., 2002; Fried et al., 2002; Hillier  et al., 2017; Pei et al., 2015; Yonehara  et al., 2016;</div><div>Yonehara et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 2001). However,  starburst amacrine cells have not been</div><div>implicated in mediating the  direction-selective responses of highly asymmetric retinal ganglion cell</div><div>types including the Fmini and JAM-B  neurons (Joesch and Meister, 2016; Kim et al., 2008;</div><div>Rousso et al., 2016). Second, unlike ON-OFF  direction-selective neurons, the direction-selectivity of</div><div>Fmini neurons is highly speed dependent,  with a peak selectivity at 585 mm/s and negligible selectiv-</div><div>ity at speeds greater than 1300 mm/s (Rousso et al., 2016). Direction-selective responses in the  par-</div><div>abigeminal nucleus were recorded at speeds  equivalent to more than 1500 mm/s on the retina. We</div><div>did not observe direction-selective  responses in the pulvinar at speeds where Fmini neurons are</div><div>direction-selective (Figure 6 and Figure  6—figure supplement 1). It is therefore  unlikely that the</div><div>Fmini neurons are contributing to these  direction-selective responses. Finally, like Fmini neurons, the</div><div>asymmetric JAM-B neurons were originally  identified as direction-selective, however, unlike ON-OFF</div><div>direction-selective neurons, their  direction-selectivity is not a robust property. Kim et al. (2008)</div><div>reported that the direction-selectivity of  JAM-B neurons is highly dependent on each neuron’s individual dendritic  asymmetry, while it has been reported that the direction-selective, but not  orien-</div><div>tation-selective, responses of JAM-B cells  are sensitive to light conditions (Joesch  and Meister,</div><div>2016; Nath  and Schwartz, 2017). The many  similarities between Fmini and JAM-B neurons suggest</div><div>that a more extensive exploration of their  response properties is necessary before they are deter-</div><div>mined to be robust encoders of directional  information in the visual scene (Rousso  et al., 2016).</div><div>The two neural circuits investigated here  are each known to mediate visually guided aversive</div><div>behaviors (Shang et al., 2018; Shang  et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015). In  this context, the responses</div><div>to biologically relevant stimuli of the  ganglion cells innervating the two circuits are of interest. We</div><div>found that neurons in the pulvinar respond  poorly to large stimuli, but responded to small, slowly</div><div>moving stimuli, which have been suggested  to mimic a distant predator (Zhang  et al., 2012). In</div><div>addition, neurons in the pulvinar and  parabigeminal nucleus respond well to quickly expanding dark</div><div>stimuli, which are thought to mimic a  quickly approaching threat (De  Franceschi et al., 2016;</div><div>Dean et al., 1989; Yilmaz and Meister, 2013). While robust responses to approaching stimuli have</div><div>been reported in both pulvinar-projecting  and parabigeminal-projecting collicular neurons, only pul-</div><div>vinar-projecting collicular neurons have  been reported to respond to small slowly moving stimuli</div><div>(Beltramo  and Scanziani, 2019; Bennett et al., 2019; Gale and Murphy, 2016; Gale  and Murphy,</div><div>2014; Shang  et al., 2018; Shang et al., 2015; Maaten  and Hinton, 2008; Inayat et al., 2015). Con-</div><div>sistent with these results, we found that  the putative ganglion cell types preferentially sampled by</div><div>the colliculo-pulvinar circuit have  smaller dendritic fields, including the Fmini-OFF cells (cluster 2),</div><div>which respond to small, dark stimuli. In  addition, the pulvinar receives strong input from cluster 10,</div><div>which based on the small dendritic size  and transient responses to a moving bar (Bae et al., 2018)</div><div>could correspond to the local ON-cells  (G17) (Baden et al., 2016) and hence provide information</div><div>about local movement. Transient OFF-alpha  cells (cluster 6) are known to preferentially respond to</div><div>expanding stimuli and could mediate these  responses in both circuits (Shang  et al., 2018;</div><div>Shang et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015). Retinal  ganglion cells with a bias for the colliculo-parabigemi-</div><div>nal circuit have larger dendritic fields  and their putative function is to respond to large moving</div><div>objects and their motion direction  (clusters 4, 7 and 13), and we found similar stimulus preferences</div><div>in the parabigeminal neurons. Together the  parabigeminal-preferring ganglion cells might detect</div><div>predators attacking from angles that are  not recognized by expansion-detectors.</div><div>Determining the link between the visual  responses of retinal ganglion cells, their central brain tar-</div><div>gets and behavior remains a central  question in visual neuroscience (Hillier  et al., 2017; Hubel and</div><div>Wiesel, 1961; Lettvin  et al., 1959; Liang et al., 2018; Roson  et al., 2019; Temizer et al., 2015).</div><div>The approaches used to achieve this have  predominantly involved recording responses in the retina</div><div>independent of recording in the brain, or  during behavior (Hillier et al.,  2017; Lettvin et al., 1959;</div><div>Usrey et al., 1998). While attempts to link particular cell  types in the retina with responses in central</div><div>brain structures and behavior have been  undertaken, clear mechanistic relationships remain limited</div><div>(Chen  et al., 2011; Hillier et al., 2017; Liang  et al., 2018; Roson et al., 2019; Shi  et al., 2017;</div><div>Yonehara et al., 2016). We believe development of approaches  that enable simultaneous record-</div><div>ings of identified retinal cell types and  central brain activity in awake behaving animals will allow us</div><div>to better understand these relationships (de Malmazet et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2018; Liang  et al.,</div><div>2018).</div><div>Visual pathways through the superior colliculus</div><div>Studies investigating the organization of  retinal inputs to single cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus</div><div>have suggested that there is a large  degree of fuzziness/variability in the information each neuron</div><div>receives from the retina (Hammer et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2018; Morgan  et al., 2016;</div><div>Rompani et al., 2017; Roson et al., 2019). Here, we demonstrate that in the superior  colliculus a</div><div>high degree of regularity exists if one  considers the projection targets. This data suggests there are</div><div>strict limits on the degree of mixing of  retinal ganglion cell inputs that occurs in the superior collicu-</div><div>lus, where each output pathway has access  to a distinct, only partially overlapping, set of visual infor-</div><div>mation encoded by the retina. The observed  regularity could exist either because the superior</div><div>colliculus has a more ‘hard-wired’  architecture; or because we focused on projection-specific disy-</div><div>naptic circuits. When considering the  layer-specific targets of the lateral geniculate nucleus in the</div><div>visual cortex, Cruz-Martin et al. suggest  that direction-selective neurons are preferentially sampled</div><div>by layer one projecting neurons of the  thalamus (Cruz-Martı´n et al., 2014). We propose that under-</div><div>    standing the specific input structure to neurons and cell types with  different projection profiles will        </div>
