<h2 data-label="792768" class="ltx_title_subsection">4. Discussion</h2><div>Comparing the morphological, molecular and visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar pathways passing through the superior colliculus has led to three conclusions (Figure 8). First, the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuit together sample from a limited set (14 of 37) of retinal ganglion cell types (Bae et al., 2018). Second, there is a clear preference in the set of retinal ganglion cell types providing input to each circuit. While four putative ganglion cell types show a strong preference for the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit, and four others for the colliculo-pulvinar circuit, six other types are more equally sampled by both circuits. Third, some response properties of neurons in downstream targets can be explained by the different and shared sampling biases of each retinal ganglion cell type by each collicular output pathway, respectively. These results support the notion that, in the superior colliculus, neural circuits are based on a dedicated set of connections between specific retinal inputs and different collicular output pathways</div><div>Ganglion cell types innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-</div><div>pulvinar circuits</div><div>The identification of the ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar</div><div>circuit was accomplished by finding the best match of each ganglion cell in our data to the cell types</div><div>in the Eyewire data base using a combination of morphological and molecular cues (Table 1). Of the</div><div>14 clusters, 8 (clusters 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13) include molecularly identified cells (Figures 2 and</div><div>3). Briefly, the cells in cluster 4 are ON-OFF direction-selective cells, based on their characteristic co-</div><div>stratification with the ChAT bands and positive CART labelling (Dhande et al., 2013; Sanes and</div><div>Masland, 2015). The four alpha ganglion cell types (cluster 13, sustained ON-alpha; cluster 11, tran-</div><div>sient ON-alpha; cluster 6, transient OFF-alpha; cluster 1, sustained OFF-alpha) were positively identi-</div><div>fied based on a combination of positive SMI32 staining, dendritic anatomy and large cell body size</div><div>(Bleckert et al., 2014; Krieger et al., 2017), as well as their visual response properties</div><div>(Baden et al., 2016). In addition, three out of the four FOXP2-positive cell types were identified</div><div>(cluster 2, Fmini-OFF; cluster 9, Fmini-ON; cluster 12, Fmidi-ON), where Fmini-OFF cells are likely</div><div>PV7 cells (Farrow et al., 2013; Rousso et al., 2016).</div><div>For the remaining six cell types (clusters 3, 5, 7, 8 10 and 14), we manually inspected published</div><div>collections of anatomical and functional retinal ganglion cell types (Baden et al., 2016;</div><div>Su¨mbu¨ l et al., 2014a; Vo¨lgyi et al., 2009). These included the small cells in cluster 8 that resemble</div><div>the HD1 or HD2 cells (Bae et al., 2018; Jacoby and Schwartz, 2017). The large ON-cells in cluster</div><div>14 might correspond to type G6 (Vo¨ lgyi et al., 2009), and resemble the Ka-cells (Su¨mbu¨l et al.,</div><div>2014a). Based on their size and the reported responses to a moving bar (Bae et al., 2018), they</div><div>best fit the ON sustained (G22) or ON local sustained (G30) type (Baden et al., 2016). We found the</div><div>best morphological match for cluster 3 and cluster 10 to be G16 and G8, respectively (Vo¨lgyi et al.,</div><div>2009), and the best functional match to be G26 (ON DS sustained) and G17 (ON local transient)</div><div>(Baden et al., 2016). Finally, the chirp response profiles of cluster 5 and 7 best fit the chirp</div><div>responses of the mini OFF-transient cells (G9) and OFF-slow cells (G4), respectively (Baden et al.,</div><div>2016). Although our identification of cell types is well grounded, the relationship between anatomi-</div><div>cal data sets (Bae et al., 2018), physiological data sets (Baden et al., 2016) and molecular identity</div><div>of cell types remains incomplete (Dhande et al., 2015; Sanes and Masland, 2015).</div>
