<div>One question we attempted to answer here was whether we could explain the different visual response properties of neurons in the parabigeminal nucleus and pulvinar by their distinct retinal inputs. While some of the differences were indeed consistent (e.g. direction-selective neurons innervate the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit and looming sensitive neurons innervate both circuits), we found clear differences in the visual responses in the retina and the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus. The classification of retinal ganglion cells was based on their generally robust responses to a full-field chirp stimulus, which fails to evoke visual responses in either the posterior pulvinar or parabigeminal nucleus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, the colliculo-pulvinar circuit receives inputs from ganglion cells that respond well to big and fast objects (cluster 11 and shared inputs from cluster 1), but responses to such stimuli were weak or absent in the pulvinar neurons. These differences might reflect strong non-linearities in how retinal inputs are integrated, or they might be a result of balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs that cancel each other out.</div><div>These differences between visual response properties of innervating retinal ganglion cells and their disynaptic central targets in the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus is in stark contrast to what is found in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, where many of the neurons respond well to full-field stimulation and their visual response properties can be understood as a linear sum of different combinations of putatively innervating retinal ganglion cell types (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib77">Roson et al., 2019</a>). Local inhibitory and excitatory connections within the superior colliculus might mediate the different full-field responses of inputs and outputs (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib33">Gale and Murphy, 2018</a>). Indeed, while inputs from the visual cortex appear to modulate the gain of visual responses within the superior colliculus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib85">Shi et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib96">Wang et al., 2010</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib107">Zhao et al., 2014</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib17">De Franceschi and Solomon, 2018</a>), removal of local inhibition in the superior colliculus reveals masked response characteristics including responses to large, stationary objects in pulvinar-projecting neurons (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib32">Gale and Murphy, 2016</a>). A more in-depth, cell-type-specific approach is needed to understand the functional consequences of selective wiring of retinal ganglion cells with their targets in the superior colliculus.</div><div>We recorded direction-selective responses in the parabigeminal nucleus but not in the pulvinar, which was mirrored by the selective innervation of ON-OFF direction-selective neurons to the colliculo-parabigeminal pathway. However, Fmini-ON, which innervate both circuits, and Fmini-OFF cells, which selectively innervate the colliculo-pulvinar circuit, have been reported to be direction-selective (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib78">Rousso et al., 2016</a>). There are three reasons why this selectivity may not make a major contribution to direction-selective responses in the superior colliculus and its downstream targets. First, it has been demonstrated that direction-selective responses in the superior colliculus rely on the inhibitory output of starburst amacrine cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib85">Shi et al., 2017</a>), where starburst amacrine cells are responsible for the direction-selective responses of ON-OFF and ON direction-selective ganglion cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib25">Euler et al., 2002</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib30">Fried et al., 2002</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib38">Hillier et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib72">Pei et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib102">Yonehara et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib101">Yonehara et al., 2013</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib103">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>). However, starburst amacrine cells have not been implicated in mediating the direction-selective responses of highly asymmetric retinal ganglion cell types including the Fmini and JAM-B neurons (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib47">Joesch and Meister, 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib51">Kim et al., 2008</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib78">Rousso et al., 2016</a>). Second, unlike ON-OFF direction-selective neurons, the direction-selectivity of Fmini neurons is highly speed dependent, with a peak selectivity at 585 µm/s and negligible selectivity at speeds greater than 1300 µm/s (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib78">Rousso et al., 2016</a>). Direction-selective responses in the parabigeminal nucleus were recorded at speeds equivalent to more than 1500 µm/s on the retina. We did not observe direction-selective responses in the pulvinar at speeds where Fmini neurons are direction-selective (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). It is therefore unlikely that the Fmini neurons are contributing to these direction-selective responses. Finally, like Fmini neurons, the asymmetric JAM-B neurons were originally identified as direction-selective, however, unlike ON-OFF direction-selective neurons, their direction-selectivity is not a robust property.&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib51">Kim et al. (2008)</a>&nbsp;reported that the direction-selectivity of JAM-B neurons is highly dependent on each neuron’s individual dendritic asymmetry, while it has been reported that the direction-selective, but not orientation-selective, responses of JAM-B cells are sensitive to light conditions (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib47">Joesch and Meister, 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib70">Nath and Schwartz, 2017</a>). The many similarities between Fmini and JAM-B neurons suggest that a more extensive exploration of their response properties is necessary before they are determined to be robust encoders of directional information in the visual scene (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib78">Rousso et al., 2016</a>).</div><div>The two neural circuits investigated here are each known to mediate visually guided aversive behaviors (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib84">Shang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib83">Shang et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib98">Wei et al., 2015</a>). In this context, the responses to biologically relevant stimuli of the ganglion cells innervating the two circuits are of interest. We found that neurons in the pulvinar respond poorly to large stimuli, but responded to small, slowly moving stimuli, which have been suggested to mimic a distant predator (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib105">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). In addition, neurons in the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus respond well to quickly expanding dark stimuli, which are thought to mimic a quickly approaching threat (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib16">De&nbsp;Franceschi et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib20">Dean et al., 1989</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib100">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</a>). While robust responses to approaching stimuli have been reported in both pulvinar-projecting and parabigeminal-projecting collicular neurons, only pulvinar-projecting collicular neurons have been reported to respond to small slowly moving stimuli (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib6">Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib8">Bennett et al., 2019</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib32">Gale and Murphy, 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib31">Gale and Murphy, 2014</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib84">Shang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib83">Shang et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib60">Maaten and Hinton, 2008</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib45">Inayat et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with these results, we found that the putative ganglion cell types preferentially sampled by the colliculo-pulvinar circuit have smaller dendritic fields, including the Fmini-OFF cells (cluster 2), which respond to small, dark stimuli. In addition, the pulvinar receives strong input from cluster 10, which based on the small dendritic size and transient responses to a moving bar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>) could correspond to the local ON-cells (G17) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>) and hence provide information about local movement. Transient OFF-alpha cells (cluster 6) are known to preferentially respond to expanding stimuli and could mediate these responses in both circuits (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib84">Shang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib83">Shang et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib98">Wei et al., 2015</a>). Retinal ganglion cells with a bias for the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit have larger dendritic fields and their putative function is to respond to large moving objects and their motion direction (clusters 4, 7 and 13), and we found similar stimulus preferences in the parabigeminal neurons. Together the parabigeminal-preferring ganglion cells might detect predators attacking from angles that are not recognized by expansion-detectors.</div><div>Determining the link between the visual responses of retinal ganglion cells, their central brain targets and behavior remains a central question in visual neuroscience (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib38">Hillier et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib43">Hubel and Wiesel, 1961</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib55">Lettvin et al., 1959</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib57">Liang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib77">Roson et al., 2019</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib91">Temizer et al., 2015</a>). The approaches used to achieve this have predominantly involved recording responses in the retina independent of recording in the brain, or during behavior (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib38">Hillier et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib55">Lettvin et al., 1959</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib93">Usrey et al., 1998</a>). While attempts to link particular cell types in the retina with responses in central brain structures and behavior have been undertaken, clear mechanistic relationships remain limited (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib11">Chen et al., 2011</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib38">Hillier et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib57">Liang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib77">Roson et al., 2019</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib85">Shi et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib102">Yonehara et al., 2016</a>). We believe development of approaches that enable simultaneous recordings of identified retinal cell types and central brain activity in awake behaving animals will allow us to better understand these relationships (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib18">de Malmazet et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib42">Hong et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib57">Liang et al., 2018</a>).</div><div><b></b></div><div><b>Visual pathways through the superior colliculus</b></div>
