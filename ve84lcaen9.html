<div>Transsynaptic rabies tracing using injections of herpes-simplex virus (HSV-rabiesG-TVA-mCherry) to target nuclei, and subsequent&nbsp;injection of EnvA-coated rabies virus (EnvA-SADΔG-GCaMP6s) to the superior colliculus proved to be a suitable tool to determine the circuit specificity of collicular projecting retinal ganglion cells. First, HSV has a strictly synaptic uptake mechanism that prevents infection of passing axons, ensuring that we labeled neurons that synapse within the pulvinar or parabigeminal nucleus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib1">Antinone and Smith, 2010</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib65">McGavern and Kang, 2011</a>). Labeling of passing axons is an issue with other retrograde tracers (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib24">Ellis et al., 2016</a>). Second, G-deleted rabies has been demonstrated to reliably label retinal ganglion cells innervating the superior colliculus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus or medial terminal nucleus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib14">Cruz-Martín et al., 2014</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib24">Ellis et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib27">Farrow et al., 2013</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib74">Rompani et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib101">Yonehara et al., 2013</a>). Finally, injection of EnvA-coated rabies virus into the superior colliculus, without previous injection of HSV-rabiesG-TVA-mCherry into either the pulvinar or parabigeminal nucleus resulted in no labeling of retinal ganglion cells in the retina or neurons in the superior colliculus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). We therefore believe that this combination of tools reliably and specifically labels retinal ganglion cells innervating the different targeted pathways of the superior colliculus.</div><div>However, while there is no evidence suggesting a retinal ganglion cell bias in rabies virus uptake, the speed with which viral particles are retrogradely transported likely varies between retinal ganglion cell types, due to differences in axonal diameter and the availability of minus-end-directed motor dynein of different cell types (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib1">Antinone and Smith, 2010</a>). These biases are reflected in the relatively large numbers of alpha retinal ganglion cells we labeled as compared to the number of small retinal ganglion cells (e.g. ON-OFF direction-selective and FOXP2<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;ganglion cells) labeled in our individual experiments (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>).</div><div>In addition, it is possible that we underestimated the number of cell types innervating these two circuits. This is for three reasons. First, clusters with&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1% of all cells were not considered as an input-providing cell type here (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</a>). If these clusters are ‘true’ inputs, a higher infection rate might reveal enough cells to be considered for further analysis. Second, we saw a large variability in the absolute numbers of neurons labeled in different experiments (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). For cell types with a low probability of being labeled they may not have been detected reliably enough to be counted. However, within each circuit, we measured a similar percentage of molecularly identified cells independent of the total number of rabies-infected cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). Third, we systematically labeled more&nbsp;neurons in pulvinar experiments as compared to parabigeminal experiments. This might be because the parabigeminal nucleus is difficult to target due to its small size or because the pulvinar receives more inputs from the colliculus. Despite this fact, four cell types (clusters 3, 4, 7 and 14) were found almost exclusively in our parabigeminal experiments.</div><div>Given these potential biases due to technical limitations, we have more cells from colliculo-pulvinar experiments in our database than from colliculo-parabigeminal experiments. The absolute number of cells found in a given cluster for each circuit is a consequence of these experimental limitations and not of the innervation strength of this cell type. We therefore do not assess the relative input strength of the different ganglion cell types to an individual circuit. Instead, we based our analysis and conclusions on a comparison of the relative distributions of individual cell types between the two circuits, and not absolute numbers. By comparing the relative percentage of the same cell types between the circuits, we have minimized this effect. We are confident that the differences in numbers of infected cells has no major effect on the relative distributions of cell types observed, and the differences we see in labeling probabilities reflect real biological differences in the wiring diagram of the two circuits. To get a complete picture of how individual neurons in each circuit are sampling retinal inputs, a single cell or sparse cell-type-specific approach is necessary (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib74">Rompani et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib101">Yonehara et al., 2013</a>).</div><div>A second tool used to limit infecting off-target brain nuclei during the injection of HSV was the&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209Cre</i>&nbsp;mouse line (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib35">Gerfen et al., 2013</a>). This mouse line ensured that we exclusively labeled wide-field neurons projecting to the pulvinar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib31">Gale and Murphy, 2014</a>). This may bias our results as it is possible that unknown collections of other cell types also project to the pulvinar from the superior colliculus. However, two pieces of evidence suggest this is unlikely. First, in a screen of different Cre-mouse lines,&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209Cre</i>&nbsp;positive neurons were found to only innervate the pulvinar, while other cell types were found to not innervate the pulvinar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib33">Gale and Murphy, 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib31">Gale and Murphy, 2014</a>). In addition, unbiased retrograde labeling of collicular neurons, using HSV, from the pulvinar has predominantly revealed wide-field neurons, though a small number of neurons that might be of a different type were also seen (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib108">Zhou et al., 2017</a>).&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib84">Shang et al. (2018)</a>&nbsp;report that a subpopulation of neurons in the PV-Cre mouse line projects to the posterior portion of the pulvinar. As these pulvinar projecting PV<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;neurons have a similar projection pattern and cell body position within the superior colliculus to&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209Cre</i>&nbsp;neurons, we think it likely that they are a subpopulation of wide-field neurons. However, while in mice only one wide-field neuronal cell type has been described, two types of wide-field neurons have been found in ground squirrels that have distinct anatomies and project to different regions within the pulvinar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib29">Fredes et al., 2012</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib62">Major et al., 2000</a>). The description of cell types within the mouse superior colliculus remains immature compared to that of mouse retinal ganglion cell types.</div>
