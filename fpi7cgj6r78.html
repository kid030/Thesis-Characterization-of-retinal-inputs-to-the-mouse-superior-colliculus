<div>In our anatomical classification, we found different innervation patterns of alpha retinal ganglion cell types for the two circuits. To be able to trace the whole dendritic tree, cells were chosen for morphological analysis based on being separate from neighboring cells. To confirm the observed differences in circuit biases (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>), we performed a survey of histological staining against molecular markers of ganglion cell types that was independent of how separated cells were. Here, we counted the number of double-positive cell bodies to establish the overall number of molecularly identified cells in each circuit and analyzed local confocal scans around the soma to determine the distribution of alpha cell types. The four alpha cell types were labeled using the SMI32-antibody (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib9">Bleckert et al., 2014</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib12">Coombs et al., 2006</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib44">Huberman et al., 2008</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib54">Krieger et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib73">Peichl et al., 1987</a>). We found that around half of all rabies-labeled cells innervating the two circuits are alpha-cells (colliculo-parabigeminal median: 42%, n&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 retinas; colliculo-pulvinar median: 53%, n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 retinas;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig3">Figure 3</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1</a>). To identify which of the four alpha cell types innervate each circuit, we acquired local z-stacks of SMI32+/GCaMP6s+&nbsp;double labeled neurons (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;91 cells in three mice for the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;90 cells in three mice for the colliculo-pulvinar circuit). Each neuron was manually classified based on dendritic stratification depth: sustained ON-alpha cells have dendrites below the ChAT-bands; the transient ON- and transient OFF-alpha cells have dendrites between the ChAT-bands, and the sustained OFF-alpha cell has dendrites above the ChAT-bands (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib9">Bleckert et al., 2014</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib54">Krieger et al., 2017</a>). Both circuits sample from sustained and transient OFF-alpha cells (parabigeminal vs pulvinar median: 13% vs 20% sustained; 32% vs 29% transient OFF-cells; 100% corresponds to all GFP+&nbsp;cells). In contrast, transient ON-cells mostly innervate the colliculo-pulvinar circuit (parabigeminal vs pulvinar median: 4% vs 17%; p&lt;0.05 two proportion z-test), while sustained ON-cells are almost exclusively labeled in the parabigeminal circuits (parabigeminal vs pulvinar median: 10% vs&nbsp;&lt;0.5%; p&lt;0.05 two proportion z-test).</div>
