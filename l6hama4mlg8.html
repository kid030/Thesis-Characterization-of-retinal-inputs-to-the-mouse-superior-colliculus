<div>To gain insights into the response properties of the retinal ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-pulvinar and colliculo-parabigeminal circuits that might explain the similarities and differences recorded in the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus, we analyzed the visual responses of the 93 retinal ganglion cells assigned to our anatomical clusters based on the response to the ‘chirp’ stimulus (see&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Fourier analysis of the responses to the frequency modulation part of the ‘chirp’ stimulus revealed a strong representation of low frequencies by cells in clusters 6 and 13 (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig7">Figure 7A</a>), while cells in clusters 1, 5 and 7 showed a more even response profile for different frequencies. Cells in clusters 4 and 11 responded weakly to the full-field ‘chirp’ stimulus. We used the responses to a white bar moving in eight directions to&nbsp;evaluate the direction- and orientation-selectivity of each neuron. As expected, only the ON-OFF direction-selective cells in cluster&nbsp;4 were direction-selective and none of the cell types showed evidence of orientation-selectivity (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig7">Figure 7B</a>). Finally, we recorded responses to a black expanding disc (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig7">Figure 7C</a>). The ON-cells in clusters 11 and 13 did not respond to this stimulus. The transient OFF-alpha cells (cluster 6), and cells in cluster 5 displayed the strongest responses during the period of expansion. The sustained OFF-alpha cells (cluster 1) and cells in cluster 7 responded later in the stimulus, with a peak firing rate as the disc reached its full size. The ON-OFF direction-selective cells (cluster 2) showed a biphasic response to the expansion stimulus.</div>
