<div>The identification of the ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuit was accomplished by finding the best match of each ganglion cell in our data to the cell types in the Eyewire data base using a combination of morphological and molecular cues (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#table1">Table 1</a>). Of the 14 clusters, 8 (clusters 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13) include molecularly identified cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figures 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig3">3</a>). Briefly, the cells in cluster&nbsp;4 are ON-OFF direction-selective cells, based on their characteristic co-stratification with the ChAT bands and positive CART labelling (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib21">Dhande et al., 2013</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib79">Sanes and Masland, 2015</a>). The four alpha ganglion cell types (cluster 13, sustained ON-alpha; cluster 11, transient ON-alpha; cluster 6, transient OFF-alpha; cluster 1, sustained OFF-alpha) were positively identified based on a combination of positive SMI32 staining, dendritic anatomy and large cell body size (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib9">Bleckert et al., 2014</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib54">Krieger et al., 2017</a>), as well as their visual response properties (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>). In addition, three out of the four FOXP2-positive cell types were identified (cluster 2, Fmini-OFF; cluster 9, Fmini-ON; cluster 12, Fmidi-ON), where Fmini-OFF cells are likely PV7 cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib27">Farrow et al., 2013</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib78">Rousso et al., 2016</a>).</div>
