<h3 data-label="974209" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The identification of the ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar circuit was accomplished by finding the best match of each ganglion cell in our data to the cell types in the Eyewire data base using a combination of morphological and molecular cues (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#table1">Table 1</a>). Of the 14 clusters, 8 (clusters 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13) include molecularly identified cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figures 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig3">3</a>). Briefly, the cells in cluster&nbsp;4 are ON-OFF direction-selective cells, based on their characteristic co-stratification with the ChAT bands and positive CART labelling (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib21">Dhande et al., 2013</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib79">Sanes and Masland, 2015</a>). The four alpha ganglion cell types (cluster 13, sustained ON-alpha; cluster 11, transient ON-alpha; cluster 6, transient OFF-alpha; cluster 1, sustained OFF-alpha) were positively identified based on a combination of positive SMI32 staining, dendritic anatomy and large cell body size (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib9">Bleckert et al., 2014</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib54">Krieger et al., 2017</a>), as well as their visual response properties (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>). In addition, three out of the four FOXP2-positive cell types were identified (cluster 2, Fmini-OFF; cluster 9, Fmini-ON; cluster 12, Fmidi-ON), where Fmini-OFF cells are likely PV7 cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib27">Farrow et al., 2013</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib78">Rousso et al., 2016</a>).</h3><div>For the remaining six cell types (clusters 3, 5, 7, 8 10 and 14), we manually inspected published collections of anatomical and functional retinal ganglion cell types (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib88">Sümbül et al., 2014a</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib95">Völgyi et al., 2009</a>). These included the small cells in cluster&nbsp;8 that resemble the HD1 or HD2 cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib46">Jacoby and Schwartz, 2017</a>). The large ON-cells in cluster 14 might correspond to type G6 (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib95">Völgyi et al., 2009</a>), and resemble the Ka-cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib88">Sümbül et al., 2014a</a>). Based on their size and the reported responses to a moving bar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>), they best fit the ON sustained (G22) or ON local sustained (G30) type (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>). We found the best morphological match for cluster 3 and cluster 10 to be G16 and G8, respectively (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib95">Völgyi et al., 2009</a>), and the best functional match to be G26 (ON DS sustained) and G17 (ON local transient) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>). Finally, the chirp response profiles of cluster 5 and 7 best fit the chirp responses of the mini OFF-transient cells (G9) and OFF-slow cells (G4), respectively (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>). Although our identification of cell types is well grounded, the relationship between anatomical data sets (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>), physiological data sets (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>) and molecular identity of cell types remains incomplete (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib22">Dhande et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib79">Sanes and Masland, 2015</a>).</div><div><b>Retrograde transsynaptic labelling of retinal ganglion cells</b></div>
