<h2 data-label="806985" class="ltx_title_subsection">Distinct colliculor cell types&nbsp;</h2><div>The superficial superior colliculus is almost purely visual. Most of the retinal inputs innevate different cell types in the colliculus. The superfical superior colliculus contains diversive neuroal cell types. By screening different molecular markers with layer-specific expression pattern, Byun et al identified at least 10 neuronal types in the (young p10-1</div><div>p13) mouse superfical superior colliculus.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In the superior colliculus, at least 5 distinct cell types: wide-field cell, horizontal cells, narrow-field cell, stellate cells and ....have been identified. They differ in the morphological properties, preferred visual stimuli and gene expression. In addition, they also differ in the target structures to which they project, suggesting that the features they detect are important for different behaviors.&nbsp;</div>
