<h2 data-label="806985" class="ltx_title_subsection">Introduction</h2><div>The superior colliculus (SC), as well as its&nbsp;non-mammalian homolog, the optic tectum, is an evolutionarily  conserved brain structure across different animal species. The SC is a laminar structure, located at the dorsal midbrain. In mice, the SC receives more than 85-90% of direct retinal input from retinal ganglion cells (RGC) (Ellis et al., 2016), which makes it the most prominent visual center in this species.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="348795" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="348795" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Organization of the superior colliculus</h3><div>The organization of the mouse SC has been characterized along multiple dimensions. First, the SC is a multisensory integration structure. It  can be divided based on its input sources with superficial&nbsp;(dorsal) layers  being visual and deeper (ventral) layers being multimodal and motor-related (May 2006, Stein 1984). The superficial layers of the SC are the major retino-recipient structure in the brain and can be further divided into several synaptic layers. Stratum zonale (SZ)&nbsp;is&nbsp;a thin, neuronal cell-sparse layer, immediately under the pial surface. Below the SZ is&nbsp;stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), or the superficial gray layer, where most RGC axons arborize. Below the SGS is the stratum opticum (SO), or the optic layers, where RGC axons enter the SC. The SO is mostly made up of retinal afferent fibers, it contains scattered neurons as well. The deeper layers of the SC consist of stratum griseum intermedium (SGI) and below. These layers have multiple sources of innervation, such as inputs from  somatosensory cortex (S1), auditory cortex and trageminal nucleus of the brainstem, as well as visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex.&nbsp; </div><div>Second, each of these modalities is topographical mapped and aligned with the others, which allows the SC to initiate orienting behavioral responses to multimodal stimuli (Cang &amp; Feldheim 2013).&nbsp;Retinal inputs are mapped topographically such that SGS and SO neurons in the surepresent the two-dimensional visual field along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes of the SC (Fig. 1A). The superficial layers of the SC also receive input from the striate and extratriate visual cortex (Wang &amp; Burkhalter 2013). The cortical inputs are also topographically organized aligned in register with retinal inputs (Triplett et al 2009).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The visual inputs are also mapped topographyically with respect to the visual field, and are alligned in retiotopic register with each other. </div><div>Firstly, contralateral RGCs along the temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina  project  along the anterior-posterior (A-P) of the SC. The dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC.&nbsp; Additionally, ipsilateral RGCs and V1 exons terminate in a slightly deeper SGS lamina and are retinotopically aligned with the contralateral rtinocollcilular map.&nbsp; (Figure.1)</div><h3 data-label="887760" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Development of sSC</h3><h3 data-label="887760" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">'Overall sSC would be nearly complete by ~P10: 1)Neurogenesis is complete during the embryonic stage and the radial thickness of the sSC reaches ~90% of its mature level by P10 (Edwards et al., 1986b); 2) Layer-restricted axonal, arborization of RGCs is complete around eye opening (P12-P14 in mouse; Kim et al., 2010), and sSC neurons acquire adult-like morphology by P15 (Warton and Jones, 1985; Sachs et al., 1986).

They occupy different locations in the SC, could be labelled in different mouse lines, molecular markers, distinct morphological properties and visual stimulus preferences. They also differ in the target structures to which they project, suggesting that the features they detect are important for different behaviors. The visual stimulus preferences and the projection targets for each type are summarized in Figure2.&nbsp;</div><div>Besides, by screening different molecular markers with layer-specific expression pattern, Byun et al identified at least 10 neuronal types in the (young p10-p13) mouse superficial superior colliculus.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="386661" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Behaviors mediated by the mouse superior colliculus&nbsp;</h3><div><i>Question: why the superior colliculus is recognized as a critical node in mediating innate behaviors?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</i></div><div>The mouse superior colliculus receives direct inputs from retina and routes this information to distinct downstream projection areas to control diverse innate behaviors.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="212849" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The superior colliculus mediates visually-guided behaviors</h3><div>Yilmaz and Meister for the first time showed an overhead looming stimulus that mimics an arterial predator efficiently triggers fleeing-to-nest or freezing responses in mice (Yilmaz and Meister 2013). Later on,&nbsp; people found the superior colliculus is a critical node in mediating the innate behaviors.&nbsp; Wei et al identified a&nbsp;subpopulation of excitatory neurons in the superior colliculus that travels through the lateral posterior nucleus (also known as lateral pulvinar, LP) targeting the amygdala responded to and mediated a freezing response to a looming stimulus.&nbsp;Another research team by applying a flashing light, induced a transient suspended locomotion behavior and found a top-down pathway from L5 neurons in the visual cortex to superior colliculus is involved in this arrest behavior (Liang et al., 2015). However, the neuronal circuit via the superior colliculus mediating the behaviors is not known. With the identification&nbsp;of the cell types in the colliculus, development of specific virus labeling and optogenetic progress, several pathways via different superior colliculus neuronal celly types have been investigated.&nbsp;Shang et al found a subpopulation of collicular neurons that are PV positive targeting Pbg that transmits further to the amygdala triggered freezing and escape responses (Shang et al 2015).  Wide-field neurons exclusively target LP, which fact leads us to believe that the collicular excitatory neurons targeting LP that induce freezing behavior are the wide-field neurons</div><div>Question: does the sc mediate other types of behavior in spite of visually-guided behaviors?&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="564958" class="ltx_title_section">Chapter1: A Projection specific logic to sampling visual inputs in mouse superior colliculus</h1><h2 data-label="459261" class="ltx_title_subsection">Abstract</h2><div>Using sensory information to trigger different behaviors relies on circuits that pass through brain regions. The rules by which parallel inputs are routed to downstream targets are poorly understood. The superior colliculus mediates a set of innate behaviors, receiving input from &gt;30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviorally important targets including the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus. Combining transsynaptic circuit tracing with in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, we observed a projection-specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. Neurons projecting to the pulvinar or the parabigeminal nucleus showed strongly biased sampling from four cell types each, while six others innervated both pathways. The visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells correlated well with those of their disynaptic targets. These findings open the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus.</div><h2 data-label="448443" class="ltx_title_subsection">Introduction</h2><div>The nervous system nervous system is built built from a large set large set of diverse neuronal cell diverse neuronal cell types that work together work together to process process information and generate behavior generate behavior (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib104">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</a>).
