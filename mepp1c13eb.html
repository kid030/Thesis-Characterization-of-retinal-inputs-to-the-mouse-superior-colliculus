<h1 data-label="996097" class="ltx_title_section">INTRODUCTION</h1><div>The superior colliculus (SC), as well as its&nbsp;non-mammalian homolog, the optic tectum, is an evolutionarily  conserved brain structure across different animal species. The SC is a laminar structure, located at the dorsal midbrain. In mice, the SC receives more than 85-90% of direct retinal input from retinal ganglion cells (RGC) (Ellis et al., 2016), which makes it the most prominent visual center in this species.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="348795" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h1 data-label="567329" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="734745" class="ltx_title_section"><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true">RGCs are the only portal of the visual world to the brain&nbsp;</span></h1><h2 data-label="348058" class="ltx_title_subsection"><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true">Anatomy structure and cell types of the retina</span></h2><div></div><div>The mouse retina is a laminar structure consisting of five cell classes, which could be further diveded into distinct cell  types. They are assembled and organized into distinct circuits that enable visual processing.&nbsp;Photoreceptors including rods (daylight detection), L-cones and S-cones (nighttime vision), reside in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina. They convert light information into electrical signals. Horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells are the interneurons that process the output of photoreceptors and occupy the inter nuclear layer (INL) of the retina. In the mouse, there is a single type of horizontal cells providing lateral feedback inhibition to regulate glutamate release from the photoreceptors. At least 13 types of bipolar cells have been identified (Euler et al. 2014; Shekhar et al 2016). They receive glutamatergic inputs from photoreceptors and GABAergic inputs from horizontal cells from the&nbsp;outer plexiform layer (OPL). In the inner plexiform layer (IPL), bipolar cells relay their signals to amacrine cells and converge in specific ratios onto the dendrites of&nbsp;retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Amacrine cells can be classified broadly as narrow or wide-field on the basis of the diameters of their dendritic trees. They make inhibitory synapses onto bipolar cell axon terminals and onto the dendrites of other amacrine and ganglion cells ().&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>relay their signals to&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="458320" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="458320" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h1 data-label="377348" class="ltx_title_section">Organization of the superior colliculus</h1><div>The organization of the mouse SC has been characterized along multiple dimensions. First, the SC is a multisensory integration structure. It  can be divided based on its input sources with superficial&nbsp;(dorsal) layers  being visual and deeper (ventral) layers being multimodal and motor-related (May 2006, Stein 1984). The superficial layers of the SC are the major retino-recipient structure in the brain and can be further divided into several synaptic layers. Stratum zonale (SZ)&nbsp;is&nbsp;a thin, neuronal cell-sparse layer, immediately under the pial surface. Below the SZ is&nbsp;stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), or the superficial gray layer, where most RGC axons arborize. Below the SGS is the stratum opticum (SO), or the optic layers, where RGC axons enter the SC. The SO is mostly made up of retinal afferent fibers, it contains scattered neurons as well. The superficial layers of the SC also receive input from the striate and extratriate visual cortex (Wang &amp; Burkhalter 2013). The deeper layers of the SC consist of stratum griseum intermedium (SGI) and below. These layers have multiple sources of innervation, such as inputs from the somatosensory cortex (S1), auditory cortex and trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, as well as visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Second, each of these modalities is topographical mapped and aligned with the others, which allows the SC to initiate behavioral responses to multimodal stimuli (Cang &amp; Feldheim 2013).&nbsp;Retinal inputs to the superficial layers of the SC are mapped topographically such that SGS and SO neurons represent the two-dimensional visual field along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes of the SC (Fig. 1A). The somatosensory and auditory inputs are organized into topographic maps that are aligned with the visual maps, such that neurons in the same vertical column have corresponding receptive field locations, either in visual and auditory space or on the body surface (Drager &amp; Hubel 1975, Stein 1984). These sensory maps are also aligned with motor maps in the deep layers of the SC that encode the direction and amplitude of saccadic eye and head movement (Sparks et al. 1990, Wurtz &amp; Albano 1980).&nbsp;Besides, the cortical inputs that terminate in the lower SGC and deeper layers are also topographically organized aligned in register with retinal inputs (Triplett et al 2009) (Fig. 1B).&nbsp; The alignment of these maps enables the SC to integrate visual, auditory, and tactile information and to initiate orienting movements to redirect attention toward salient stimuli.</div>
