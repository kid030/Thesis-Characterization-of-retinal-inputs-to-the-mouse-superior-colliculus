<div>As an additional confirmation for the correct assignment of cells to the Eyewire clusters, we tested whether putative cell types showed the expected spatial distribution across the retina. For each of the retinal ganglion cell, we mapped its size onto its position within the retina. This revealed the expected general increase of dendritic size with distance from the optic nerve head for the whole ganglion cell population (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5A,E and I</a>). We then checked the spatial distribution of dendritic sizes of the sustained OFF and ON-alpha ganglion cells and the transient OFF-alpha cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5B–D</a>). It has previously been demonstrated that sustained ON and OFF-alpha cells, but not transient OFF-alpha cells show a strong asymmetric decrease of dendritic size along the naso-temporal axis (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib9">Bleckert et al., 2014</a>). We found that the two sustained types show the previously reported negative correlation along the naso-temporal axis with small neurons found preferentially in the temporal retina (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5F–G</a>), and also replicated the equal distribution with respect to the distance from the optic nerve head (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5J–K</a>). As expected, we did not observe any asymmetry in dendritic size of transient OFF-alpha cells along the naso–temporal axis (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5H–L</a>) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib9">Bleckert et al., 2014</a>). In addition, while transient OFF-alpha cells do not show an asymmetric distribution of dendritic size, they do display an increasing response duration along the ventral – dorsal axis of the retina (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib97">Warwick et al., 2018</a>). We found a similar increase in response duration for transient OFF-alpha neurons along this axis of the retina that was consistent, though with a weaker correlation, with&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib97">Warwick et al. (2018)</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5M–P</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that our assignment of cell types based on anatomy are consistent with the known spatial distributions of anatomical and physiological characteristics of ganglion cells across the retina.</div>
