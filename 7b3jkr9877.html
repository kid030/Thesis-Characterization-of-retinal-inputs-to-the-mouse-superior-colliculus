<div>Similar procedures were used to stain the retinas for neurofilament or CART. After fixation, freeze-cracking and blocking, primary antibody solution was added and the retinas were incubated for 5–7 days with gentle shaking at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were chicken anti-GFP (Invitrogen, A-10262, 1:500), goat anti-ChAT (Chemicon, Ab144P, 1:200), mouse SMI32 (Biolend, 801701,1:1000) and rabbit anti-CART (Phoenix, H-003–62,1:500). They were prepared in 3% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS. Retinas were washed three times, 15 min each, in 1x PBS with 0.5% TritonX-100 before being transferred into the secondary antibody solution consisting of Alexa488 donkey anti-chicken (ImmunoJackson, 703-545-155, 1:500) and Alexa633 donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen A-21082, 1:500), Cy3 donkey anti-mouse (ImmunoJackson, 715-165-151, 1:400) and DyLight 405 donkey anti-rabbit (ImmunoJackson, 715-475-150, 1:200) with 3% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS. Retinas were incubated in secondary antibody solution overnight at 4°C. Slices were washed three times for 10–15 min each in 1x PBS with 0.5% TritonX-100 and 1 time in 1x PBS. Mounting procedures are the same as listed above.</div>
