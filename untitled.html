The corresponding broad categories of light intensity are called scotopic (only rods are active, starlight vision), mesopic (both rods and cones are active), and photopic (rods are saturated, and only cones are active, daylight vision). Rods and cones convet their signals through specialized circuits, eventially converging onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. There are more than 40 different functional types, each of them transmitting information to the brain about ta certain subset of features of the image stream impinging onto the photoreceptors. The specific response pattern of each ganglion cell type is largely shaped by the connectivity with the presynaptic circuitry and the precise Spatio-temporal interactions of all cells involved (bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells). Sophisticated response patterns produced by retinal ganglion cells include direction-selective response, approach-sensitive response, object-specific motion sensitivity, or color specificity.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="249070" class="ltx_title_subsection">Superior Colliculus</h2><h3 data-label="726803" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"> SC Structure and Organization</h3><div>Superior colliculus (SC) is an integrative sensorimotor structure that receives inputs from multi-sensory modalities. It is organized into several synaptic layers:&nbsp; the stratum zonale (SZ), a thin layer located just below the pial surface; the stratum griseum superficialis (SGS) where most RGC axons arborize, and which can itself be further divided into upper (uSGS) and lower (lSGS) sublayers; the stratum opticum (SO); deeper SC, which can be further subdivided into stratum griseum intermidiaum (SGI) and below (dSC). </div><div>There are three key features of SC organization, which are conserved among different species. First,  along the superficial to the deep axis with the superficial layers being visual, which receives around&nbsp;85-90% retinal inputs&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ellis_2016}</cite> and deeper layers multimodal and premotor. Second, each of these layers has distinct sources of innervation, each of the SC layers as distinct sources of innervation. Within the SGC,&nbsp; different RGC types also project to different sublaminar.&nbsp;The SCS received direct inputs from contralateral retinal ganglion cells (RGC). For example, on-off direction-selective (ooDS) cells project to the upper uSGC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2010}</cite>, alpha ganglion cells project to the lSGS (ref). lSGC also receives ipsilateral retinal inputs from the primary and extrastriate visual cortex. The deeper SC receives sensory inputs from multiple modalities, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the auditory nuclei of the midbrain, the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, and visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex. Deep layers of the SC  contain premotor neurons that control rapid eye movements known as saccades (???).&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;individual SC layers contain topographic maps of the sensory periphery or motor commands, and these maps are in register across layers. The alignment of these maps allows the SC to integrate multisensory information and to initiate orienting movements toward salient stimuli. Retinal inputs to the superficial layer are mapped topographically with respect to the visual field. Temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina projects along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the SC, and the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC. Retinal inputs from contralateral and ipsilateral eys, and V1, and other sensory inputs are all topographically organized&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Triplett_2009,Triplett_2012}</cite>. This organization enables neurons from different sensory modalities that monitor the same position of the environment terminate in the register but in distinct laminar.&nbsp;</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="366801"></h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection" data-label="366801">Background knowledge</h2><h3 class="ltx_title_subsubsection" data-label="383814">Different mouse model </h3><div>Cnga3 <sup>-/-</sup>, rod-only retina with non-functional cones.&nbsp;</div><div>Rho<sup>-/-</sup>, cone-only retina with non-functional rods.&nbsp;</div><div>Opna4<sup>-/-</sup>,&nbsp;melanopsin lacking retina.</div><div>PV-Cre:The PV-Cre knockin allele has the endogenous parvalbumin (<i>Pvalb</i>) promoter/enhancer elements&nbsp; directing Cre recombinase expression to&nbsp;<i>Pvalb</i>-expressing cells.

After 5-10 days of rabies injection, retinas were isolated from mice that were dark-adapted for a minimum of 30 minutes. Retina isolation was done under deep red illumination in Ringer's medium (110mM NaCl, 2.5mM KCL, 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.6mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM D-glucose, 22mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>/ 95% O<sub>2</sub>, PH 7.4 ).

Signals were digitized at 20kHz (National Instruments) and acquired using WaverSurfer software (v0.918)&nbsp;written in MATLAB. The spiking responses were recorded using the patch-clamp technique in loose cell-attached mode with electrodes pulled to 3-5 MΩ resistance and filled with filtered Ringer’s medium. To visualize the pipette, a fluorescent dye Alexa 555 was added to the Ringer’s medium.&nbsp;Fluorescent cells were  targeted for recording using a two-photon microscope (Scientifica) equipped with a Mai Tai HP two-photon laser (Spectra Physics) integrated into the electrophysiological setup (Figure xx). To facilitate targeting, two-photon fluorescent images were overlaid with the IR image acquired through a CCD camera. Infrared light was produced using the light from an LED. For some cells, z-stacks were acquired using ScanImage (Vidrio Technologies). </div><div></div><div></div><h3 data-label="647843" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Presentation of Visual Stimuli</h3><div>Stimuli were generated with an LCD projector (Samsung, SP F10M) at a refresh rate of 60Hz, controlled with custom software written in Octave based on Psychtoobox. </div><div>The light path contained two motorized filter wheels. One wheel contained a set of natural density (ND) filters (Thorlabs NE10B-A to NE50B-A), with optical densities from 1 (ND1) to 5 (ND5), that were used to control the stimulus intensity in logarithmic steps. Another wheel contained a set of filters, that were used to achieve defined transmission properties. All&nbsp;the recordings were performed with ND2 or ND1 filter.&nbsp; For two-photon targeted patch-clamp, we use 750nm filter with ND filter&nbsp;to look for the GCaMP6-expressing cell to avoid bleaching the PMT. Once the cell is patched, we use the ND filter only, while showing the visual stimuli. For two-photon recording, we use 435nm filter to the recording while showing the visual stimuli. 750nm long-pass filter passes long-wavelength (&gt;750nm). Our laser is set at 920nm to activate GCaMP6. So only the activated GCaMP6 signal will be captured by the green PMT. When we were doing two-photon recoding while showing the visual stimulus. We set the visual background as blue instead of gray, as the mice have cones for short wavelength. With the 435nm filter, we could let the blue light pass through without bleaching the PMT.&nbsp;</div><div>The projector produced a light spectrum that ranged from ~430nm to ~670nm. The power produced by the projector was 240 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at the retina. The output of the projector ranges from black (0) to white (255) pixels. All stimuli were grayscale images with pixel values between 0 (black) and 255 (white). The background was kept at 30 (gray). The stimuli were balanced so that the mean intensity over time equaled background. The following visual stimuli were used for retinal recordings:&nbsp;</div><ol><li>Full-field 'chirp' modulation:                                     A full-field stimulus based on the “chirp” stimulus (Baden et al., 2016) starting with slow  transitions gray-black-gray-white-gray (3 sec at each level), followed by a  temporal modulation between black and white starting at 0.5 Hz and increasing  to 8 Hz over a time of 6 sec. After 3 sec at a gray screen, the contrast was  modulated from 0 to 100% over a time period of 5.5 sec at 2 Hz. The stimulus  was repeated 10 times </li><li>Spot-size: A black or white spot of 6 sizes (4°, 8°, 12°, 16°, 20°, 40°) was shown  for 2 sec at the center of the gray screen. Both the colors and the sizes were shown  in random sequence. </li><li>Large moving bar: A black bar with a width of 40° moved with a speed of  150°/sec across the screen in 8 directions (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°,  270°, 315°). Each direction was repeated 5 times. The directions were  randomized.</li><li>Expansion: A black disc linearly expanded from 2° to 50° of diameter within 300 ms  (150°/sec) at the center of the screen. The stimulus was repeated 10 times. </li><li>Dimming: A disc of 50° diameter linearly dimmed from background gray to black  within 300 ms (150°/sec) at the center of the screen.

Each  condition was repeated 10 times.</li><li>Slow-small objects: A black disc of 4° diameter moved with 21°/sec in two  direction (left-right, right-left) at the center line across the screen. Each  direction was repeated 5 times.</li></ol><h3 data-label="874824" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Quantification and statistical anaylysis</h3><div>Morphology of individual ganglion cell</div><h1 data-label="942511" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>To label the dendritic trees of the imaged cells in the confocal Z-stacks, we either applied a thresholding approach to identify pixels belonging to the cells, or we sent the data set to Ariadne-service GmbH (Switzerland; ariadne.ai) for tracing of the dendritic tree. The position of the ChAT-planes was extracted and used to warp both the ChAT-signal as well as the binary Z-stack of the labelled cell. Then, dendrites from other cells, noise, and axons were removed and the position of the cell body was measured. The resulting warped dendritic&nbsp;was used for further analysis such as computation of the dendritic profile, area measurements and dendritic statistics. All code can be found on github (<a href="https://github.com/farrowlab/">https://github.com/farrowlab/</a>). </div><div>Down-sampling and binarization / tracing: The confocal Z-stacks of individual ganglion cells were denoised using the CANDLE package for MATLAB (Coup. et al., 2012) and down-sampled to have a resolution of XYZ = 0.5 x 0.5 x (0.25 to 0.35) μm per pixel and saved as MATLAB files. We then manually selected a threshold to transform the GFP-signal (i.e. the labelled cell) into a binary version where the whole dendritic tree was visible but noise was reduced as much as possible using an adapted version of the method described in (Sümbül et al., 2014a, 2014b). Alternatively, the confocal Z-stacks were sent to Ariadne-service GmbH where the dendritic tree of each neuron was traced.</div><div>Extraction of ChAT-positions: ChAT-band positions were either extracted manually or automatically using a convolutional neural network. For manual extraction, the ChAT-signal was smoothed using a two-dimensional standard-deviation filtering approach in the XY plane with a size of 21 x 21 pixels. The resulting Z-stacks were loaded into Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012). ChAT-band positions were marked as described in (Sümbül et al., 2014a). Briefly, we labeled points in the ON- and OFF-band with an&nbsp;approximate spacing of 20 μm in X- and Y-direction. For automated labelling, an end-to-end 3D Convolutional Neural Network called V-Net with a Dice Loss Layer (Milletari et al., 2016) was trained on noisy greyscale images of ChAT-images, to denoise and remove any cell bodies, creating a probability map of background and foreground, with foreground being voxels that might belong to the ChAT-bands. Two smoothness-regularized-least squares surfaces were fitted to manually labelled data to train the algorithm and to create ground truth binary masks. Then, Otsu's thresholding method combined with connected component analysis was performed on the resulting probability map to automatically locate the points that belong to the ChAT-bands in new data- sets. Finally, two surfaces were independently fit to the corresponding data points to approximate the two-ChAT-bands (<a href="https://github.com/farrowlab/ChATbandsDetection">https://github.com/farrowlab/ChATbandsDetection</a>).&nbsp;</div><div>Warping: An adapted version of the code developed in the lab of Sebastian Seung was used to warp the GFP-signal (Sümbül et al., 2014a). Briefly, the ChAT-band locations were used to create a surface map, which then was straightened in 3D-space. Then, the binarized GFP-signal was warped accordingly.</div><div>Soma position and removal of noise: After warping, the soma position was determined by filtering the GFP signal with a circular kernel (adapted from (Sümbül et al., 2014a). If this method detected the soma, it was used to remove the soma from the GFP-data and the center of mass was taken as the soma position. If this automated method failed, the soma position was marked manually. Afterwards, dendrites of other cells, axons, and noise were removed manually: The warped GFP-signal was plotted in side-view and en-face view in MATLAB and pixels belonging to the cell were selected manually.</div><div>Computation of the dendritic profile and area: The distribution of the cell’s dendritic tree was computed (Sümbül et al., 2014a). Briefly, the Z-positions of all GFP-positive pixels were normalized to be between -0.5 and 0.5. Then the Fourier transform of an interpolating low-pass filter was used to filter the Z-positions. This resulted in a vector containing the distribution of pixels in the Z-direction. If necessary, this profile was used to manually remove remaining axonal or somal pixels. In this case, the dendritic profile was computed again after cleaning of the data. The area of the dendritic tree was approximated by computing a convex hull (regionprops function in MATLAB). When diameters are given, they were calculated as D = 2*(area / π)1/2.</div><div>Computation of the dendritic statistics: To compute the dendritic statistics a minimal spanning tree model was created of each imaged dendritic tree using the TREES toolbox with a branching factor of 0.4. From this tree we calculated a set of five statistics including: the mean ratio of path length and Euclidean distance; maximum metric path length; mean branch lengths; mean path length and z-range against width of spanning field (Cuntz et al., 2011).</div><div>Down-sampling of dendritic tree for plotting: For en-face plots of the dendritic arbor, they were down sampled by calculating the local neighborhood median of all labelled pixels in patches of 50 x 50 pixels and with a sliding window of 10 pixels.</div>
