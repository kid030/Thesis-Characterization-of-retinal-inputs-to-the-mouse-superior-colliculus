However, the rules by which parallel inputs are routed to downstream targets are poorly understood.&nbsp;</div><div>The mouse superior colliculus mediates a set of visually guided innate behaviors by receiving input from &gt;30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviorally important circuits. These circuits are mediated by several groups of collicular neurons with diverse morphology, visual response properties, and long-range targets including&nbsp;the pulvinar, lateral geniculate nucleus, and parabigeminal nucleus.&nbsp; Each collicular neuron has been estimated to receive input from on average six retinal ganglion cells. However, the different ganglion cell types that provide input to specific superior collicular output pathways have not been characterized. By comparing the morphological, molecular and visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells innervating colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar pathways through the superior colliculus, we found a projection-specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. These findings raise the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus.</div><div>To test this idea, we focus on a population of collicular neurons - horizontal cells, which provide inhibitory inputs to downstream targets, including the lateral geniculate nucleus and parabigeminal nucleus. We ask whether each output pathway shares a  common set of retinal inputs and whether the different pathways mediate distinct behaviors. Using a retrograde tracer and characterization of the neuronal response properties, we found that horizontal cells are made up of two anatomically and functionally distinct populations defined by their projections to LGN and Pbg. Manipulating these two distinct populations&nbsp;<span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">that target either LGN and PBg results in&nbsp;different behavior outputs.&nbsp;By comparing the ganglion cell types providing inputs to these circuits.&nbsp;<span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">We found xxx.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div>Token together, our findings strongly support the notion that, in the superior colliculus, neuronal circuits are based on a dedicated set of connections between specific retinal inputs and different collicular output pathways.&nbsp;</div>
