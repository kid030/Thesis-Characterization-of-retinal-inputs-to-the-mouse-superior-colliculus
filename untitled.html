However, the rules by which parallel inputs are routed to downstream targets are poorly understood.&nbsp;</div><div>The mouse superior colliculus mediates a set of visually guided innate behaviors by receiving input from &gt;30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviorally important circuits. These circuits are mediated by several groups of collicular neurons with diverse morphology, visual response properties, and long-range targets including&nbsp;the pulvinar, lateral geniculate nucleus, and parabigeminal nucleus.&nbsp; Each collicular neuron has been estimated to receive input from on average six retinal ganglion cells. However, the different ganglion cell types that provide input to specific superior collicular output pathways have not been characterized. By comparing the morphological, molecular and visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells innervating colliculo-parabigeminal and colliculo-pulvinar pathways through the superior colliculus, we found a projection-specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. These findings raise the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus.</div><div>To test this idea, we focus on a population of collicular neurons - horizontal cells, which provide inhibitory inputs to downstream targets, including the lateral geniculate nucleus and parabigeminal nucleus. We ask whether each output pathway shares a  common set of retinal inputs and whether the different pathways mediate distinct behaviors. Using a retrograde tracer and characterization of the neuronal response properties, we found that horizontal cells are made up of two anatomically and functionally distinct populations defined by their projections to LGN and Pbg. Manipulating these two distinct populations&nbsp;<span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">that target either LGN and PBg results in&nbsp;different behavior outputs.&nbsp;By comparing the ganglion cell types providing inputs to these circuits.&nbsp;<span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">We found xxx.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div>Token together, our findings strongly support the notion that, in the superior colliculus, neuronal circuits are based on a dedicated set of connections between specific retinal inputs and different collicular output pathways.&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="996097" class="ltx_title_section">INTRODUCTION</h1><div>Animals, including humans, rely mostly on the vision to explore the world, make decisions, and perform various behavioral tasks. Visual processing starts from the retina and is carried out by distinct cell classes and their neurites that are located at segregating layers of the retina, which results in a number of unique visual features.&nbsp;The output neurons, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) consist of more than 30 functionally defined types,&nbsp; each responds best to a particular feature of the visual world. They directly project parallel visual information&nbsp;to different brain targets and further to trigger a series of different behaviors through other downstream circuits. Among the diverse central projections of the retinal ganglion cells, the superior colliculus (SC), as well as its&nbsp;non-mammalian homolog, the optic tectum, is an evolutionarily conserved brain structure across different animal species. It is a laminar structure, located at the dorsal midbrain. In mice, the SC receives more than 85-90% of direct retinal input from retinal ganglion cells (RGC) (Ellis et al., 2016), which makes it the most prominent visual center in this species.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="348795" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h1 data-label="567329" class="ltx_title_section">The mouse retina</h1><h2 data-label="762708" class="ltx_title_subsection">Organization of  the mouse retina</h2><div>The mouse retina is a laminar structure consisting of five cell classes of neurons, which could be further divided into distinct cell types. They are assembled and organized into distinct circuits that enable visual processing.&nbsp;Photoreceptors including rods (daylight detection) and L- and S-cones (nighttime vision), reside in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina. They convert the light information into electrical signals. Horizontal, bipolar, and amacrine cells are the interneurons that process the output of photoreceptors and occupy the inter nuclear layer (INL) of the retina. There is one single type of horizontal cells and at least 13 types of bipolar cells in the mouse(Euler et al. 2014; Shekhar et al 2016). Horizontal cells provide lateral feedback inhibition to regulate glutamate release from the photoreceptors. Bipolar cells  receive glutamatergic inputs from photoreceptors and GABAergic inputs from horizontal cells from the&nbsp;outer plexiform layer (OPL). In the inner plexiform layer (IPL), bipolar cells relay their signals to amacrine cells and converge in specific ratios onto the dendrites of&nbsp;retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Amacrine cells can be classified broadly as narrow or wide-field on the basis of the diameters of their dendritic trees. They make inhibitory synapses onto bipolar cell axon terminals and onto the dendrites of other amacrine and ganglion cells (Demb &amp; Singer 2015). The cell bodies of RGCs reside in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), the innermost nuclear layer. The RGCs receive the filtered and shaped signals from bipolar and amacrine cells and convey visual information to the rest of the brain through the optic nerve.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="640828" class="ltx_title_subsection">Major retinal ganglion cell types</h2><div>Retinal ganglion cells are the only portal to the brain conveying the visual information of the world. Understanding the retinal ganglion cell types are the key to understand what the eyes tell our brian.&nbsp;</div><div>Firstly, all RGCs share several features. Their somata are located in the ganglion cell layer, their spine-free dendrites arborize in the IPL, and their exons travel through the optic nerve to different brain areas (see the projection of the RGCs). Molecularly, pan-RGC markers include the cell surface protein Thy1, transcription factors of the Brn3 (Pou4F) family, and the RNA-binding protein RBPMS. The RGCs are also heterogeneous, by combining&nbsp;morphological, physiological, molecular, and mosaic criteria,&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true">RGCs can be divided into at least 30 ganglion cell types or 25 clear types (Roska and Meister 2014).&nbsp;</span></div><div><i>On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells(ooDSGCs)&nbsp;</i></div><div>ooDSGCs respond to both light and dark edges moving along a particular direction with a broad range of speeds (up to 60 deg/s) (Oyster et al 1972, Weng et al 2005, Sivyer et al 2010). They have a similar bistratified dendritic morphology, with dendrites tightly aligned with both ON and OFF dendrites of starburst amacrine cells. Molecularly, the neuropeptide CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) distinguishes all ooDSGCs from other types of RGCs (Kay et al 2011). Based on the directional preference, they are further divided into four discrete subtypes that are sensitive to upward, downward, backward, and forward motion direction, respectively (Oyster &amp; Barlow 1967, Elstrott et al 2008). Each type forms a separate mosaic and could be labeled in different transgenetic mouse lines (ref).&nbsp;</div><div><i>On direction-selective ganglion cells&nbsp;(On DSGCs)&nbsp;</i></div><div>On DSGCs respond to only light but not dark edges moving along a particular axis of the visual field with a slower movement speed than that of ooDSGCs. Their monostratified dendrites stratify with the ON starburst cells in the IPL. On DSGCs consist of three subtypes, each responds best to motion in one direction: upward, backward, and forward.&nbsp;</div><div><i>Alpha ganglion cells (</i>αRGCs)</div><div>αRGCs have monostratified morphology with their dendrites stratifying at different depths of IPL. They have relatively large somas and dendritic arbor size and are neurofilament rich (SMI32 antibody positive). Based&nbsp; on the response properties of their receptive field centers, αRGCs are divided into four subtypes: On-transient, On-sustained, Off-transient, and Off sustained (Pang et al .2003, van Wyk et al. 2009, Stafford et al 2010)</div><div><i>Intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin-containing ganglion cells&nbsp;(ipRGCs)</i></div><div>ipRGCs occupies less than 2% of all RGCs in the retina. They have large dendritic arbor and express melanopsin, which empowers them an intrinsic sensitivity to light. They display sustained responses to steady illumination and thereby encode global light intensity levels in the ambient environment (Zhao et al 2014). Five ipRGCs (M1-M5) have been identified, all but one of which is monostratified, and each of which posses a different level of intrinsic photosensitivity attributable to varying levels of melanopsin expression (Ecker et al 2010, Hu et al 2013).&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="982878" class="ltx_title_subsection">Central projection of the retinal ganglion cells</h2><div>The retinorecipient areas contain more than 40 different brain structures, each of which receives direct input from RGCs (Morin &amp; Studholme 2014). The retinofugal pathways can be separated based on their functional distinction, into two general categories: non-image-forming versus image-forming pathways. The non-image-forming pathways include circuits that govern the core physical function of the whole-animal, such as&nbsp;the entrainment of the circadian rhythm and control the light-driven involuntary reflexive behaviors, such as the pupillary light reflex (PLR) and eye movements that ensure image stabilization. In contrast, image-forming pathways are responsible for encoding complex visual features (motion direction, contrast, color, and locations)&nbsp; and involve conscious perception.&nbsp;</div><div>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes the circadian clock in the bain. It synchronizes the&nbsp;endogenous rhythm to a 24-hour cycle and is coupled to the ambient light-dark cycle. The SCN receives predominately input from M1 and M2 ipRGCs, and they appear to innervate distinct subregions of SCN. M1 ipRGCs that lack the transcription factor Brn3b target the SCN, whereas Brn3b+ 1 ipRGCs target the shell of the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), which is a critical hub in the central PLR pathway. Specifically killing the OPN-projecting M1 Brn3b+ neurons resulted in an abrogated PLR (Chen et al 201). There are also other non-M1 ipRGCs projecting to the core of OPN, but their contributions to PLR remain to be determined. The optokinetic reflex (OKR) and the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR)&nbsp; system work in concert over both slow and fast movement to elicit the compensatory eye movements necessary to gaze stabilization.&nbsp; Direction selective RGCs and their targeted brainstem targets of the accessory optic system (AOS), namely optic tract (NOT) and the dorsal and medial of the terminal nuclei (DTN and MTN), has been implicated in&nbsp;driving the OKR.&nbsp;In detail, both On-DSGCs and ooDSGCs encoding forward motion project to the NOT and DTN. The dorsal and ventral MTN receive input from On-DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion</div><h1 data-label="377348" class="ltx_title_section">The mouse superior colliculus </h1><h2 data-label="833619" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="833619" class="ltx_title_subsection">Organization of the superior colliculus</h2><div>The organization of the mouse SC has been characterized along multiple dimensions. First, the SC is a multisensory integration structure. It  can be divided based on its input sources with superficial&nbsp;(dorsal) layers  being visual and deeper (ventral) layers being multimodal and motor-related (May 2006, Stein 1984). The superficial layers of the SC are the major retino-recipient structure in the brain and can be further divided into several synaptic layers. Stratum zonale (SZ)&nbsp;is&nbsp;a thin, neuronal cell-sparse layer, immediately under the pial surface. Below the SZ is&nbsp;stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), or the superficial gray layer, where most RGC axons arborize. Below the SGS is the stratum opticum (SO), or the optic layers, where RGC axons enter the SC. The SO is mostly made up of retinal afferent fibers, it contains scattered neurons as well. The superficial layers of the SC also receive input from the striate and extratriate visual cortex (Wang &amp; Burkhalter 2013). The deeper layers of the SC consist of stratum griseum intermedium (SGI) and below. These layers have multiple sources of innervation, such as inputs from the somatosensory cortex (S1), auditory cortex and trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, as well as visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Second, each of these modalities is topographical mapped and aligned with the others, which allows the SC to initiate behavioral responses to multimodal stimuli (Cang &amp; Feldheim 2013).&nbsp;Retinal inputs to the superficial layers of the SC are mapped topographically such that SGS and SO neurons represent the two-dimensional visual field along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes of the SC (Fig. 1A). The somatosensory and auditory inputs are organized into topographic maps that are aligned with the visual maps, such that neurons in the same vertical column have corresponding receptive field locations, either in visual and auditory space or on the body surface (Drager &amp; Hubel 1975, Stein 1984). These sensory maps are also aligned with motor maps in the deep layers of the SC that encode the direction and amplitude of saccadic eye and head movement (Sparks et al. 1990, Wurtz &amp; Albano 1980).&nbsp;Besides, the cortical inputs that terminate in the lower SGC and deeper layers are also topographically organized aligned in register with retinal inputs (Triplett et al 2009) (Fig. 1B).&nbsp; The alignment of these maps enables the SC to integrate visual, auditory, and tactile information and to initiate orienting movements to redirect attention toward salient stimuli.</div>
