Many mammals including humans rely on vision a</div><div>Retina:</div><div>Superior colliculus (SC) is an integrative sensorimotor structure that receives inputs from multi-sensory modalities. It is organized into several synaptic layers:&nbsp; the stratum zonale (SZ), a thin layer located just below the pial surface; the stratum griseum superficialis (SGS) where most RGC axons arborize, and which can itself be further divided into upper (uSGS) and lower (lSGS) sublayers; the stratum opticum (SO); deeper SC, which can be further subdivided into stratum griseum intermidiaum (SGI) and below (dSC).&nbsp;</div><div>There are three key features of SC organization, which are conserved among different species. First,  along the superficial to the deep axis with the superficial layers being visual, which receives around&nbsp;85-90% retinal inputs&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ellis_2016}</cite> and deeper layers multimodal and premotor. Second, each of these layers has distinct sources of innervation, each of the SC layers as distinct sources of innervation. Within the SGC,&nbsp; different RGC types also project to different sublaminar.&nbsp;The SCS received direct inputs from contralateral retinal ganglion cells (RGC). For example, on-off direction-selective (ooDS) cells project to the upper uSGC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2010}</cite>, alpha ganglion cells project to the lSGS (ref). lSGC also receives ipsilateral retinal inputs from the primary and extrastriate visual cortex. The deeper SC receives sensory inputs from multiple modalities, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the auditory nuclei of the midbrain, the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, and visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex. Deep layers of the SC  contain premotor neurons that control rapid eye movements known as saccades (???).&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;individual SC layers contain topographic maps of the sensory periphery or motor commands, and these maps are in register across layers. The alignment of these maps allows the SC to integrate multisensory information and to initiate orienting movements toward salient stimuli. Retinal inputs to the superficial layer are mapped topographically with respect to the visual field. Temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina projects along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the SC, and the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC. Retinal inputs from contralateral and ipsilateral eys, and V1, and other sensory inputs are all topographically organized&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Triplett_2009,Triplett_2012}</cite>. This organization enables neurons from different sensory modalities that monitor the same position of the environment terminate in the register but in distinct laminar.&nbsp;</div>
