<div>The dissected retinas were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Histofix, ROTH, P087.5mm) with 100 mM sucrose for 30 min at 4°C, and then transferred to a 24-well plate filled with 1x PBS and washed three times for 10 min at room temperature or transferred into 15 ml 1x PBS and washed overnight or longer at 4°C. After washing, retinas were transferred to wells containing 10% sucrose in 1x PBS with 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;(w/v) and allowed to sink for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. Then retinas were transferred to wells containing 20% sucrose in 1x PBS with 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;(w/v) and allowed to sink for a minimum of 1 hr at room temperature. Finally, retinas were put into 30% sucrose in 1x PBS with 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;(w/v) and allowed to sink overnight at 4°C. The next day, freeze-cracking was performed: retinas were frozen on a slide fully covered with 30% sucrose for 3–5 min on dry ice. The slides were then thawed at room temperature. The freeze–thaw cycle was repeated two times. Retinas were washed 3 times for 10 min each in 1x PBS, followed by incubation with blocking buffer (10% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS) for at least 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibody solution was added after blocking and retinas were incubated for 5–7 days under constant gentle shaking at room temperature. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, A-11122, 1:500) and goat anti-ChAT (Chemicon, Ab144P, 1:200). They were prepared in 3% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS. After incubation, retinas were washed three times for 10 min in 1x PBS with 0.5% TritonX-100 before being transferred into the secondary antibody solution (Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A21206, 1:500) and Alexa633 donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen A-21082, 1:500); prepared in 3% NDS, 1% BSA, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;in 1x PBS). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Roche, 10236276001, 1:500) together with the secondary antibody solution. The retinas were incubated in the secondary antibody with DAPI solution overnight at 4°C. Retinas were then washed three times in 1x PBS with 0.5% TritonX-100 and 1 time in 1x PBS. For mounting, we used 2,2′-Thiodiethanol (TDE) (Sigma, 166782–500G) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib86">Staudt et al., 2007</a>) to exchange the water in the sample. To achieve this, retinas were incubated in different concentration of TDE buffer (10% -&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;25% -&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;50% -&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;97%) for at least 30 min each. Then the retinas were embedded in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo, P36934) and gently covered with a #0 coverslip (MARIENFEL, 0100032, No.0, 18*18 mm). To avoid squeezing the retinas, we put four strips of Parafilm (Parafilm, PM999) around the retina before adding the coverslip. Some of the retinas were mounted in 97% TDE with DABCO (Sigma, 290734) after immersion into TDE. Some retinas were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant directly after washing. Afterwards, nail polish was used to prevent evaporation and the samples were stored in darkness at 4°C.</div><div></div><div>Retina immunohistochemistry (SMI32, CART and FOXP2)</div>
