<div>(<b>A–C</b>). Labeling retinal inputs to the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit. (<b>A</b>) Injection strategy for labeling the circuit connecting the retina to the parabigeminal nucleus, via the superior colliculus. (<b>B</b>) Example retina with labeled ganglion cells innervating the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit. Scale bar: 500 µm. (<b>C</b>) Zoom into cyan box in B. Scale bar: 50 µm. (<b>D</b>) Eight example retinal ganglion cells from either injection approach (parabigeminal nucleus or pulvinar). Left: en-face view of the dendritic tree. Right: side-view of the dendritic tree. Location of the ChAT-bands is indicated with two gray lines. The cells are separated into four stratification groups: bistratified (first column), below (second column), between (third column), and above the ChAT-bands (last column). (<b>E</b>) Distribution of dendritic tree diameter of retinal ganglion cells that are part of the colliculo-pulvinar (LP; orange) and the colliculo-parabigeminal (Pbg; green) circuit. **p&lt;0.01 Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon rank sum test. (<b>F</b>) Retinal ganglion cell diameters for cells stratifying below, between, and above ChAT-bands. **p&lt;0.01 Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon rank sum test. (<b>G</b>) Retinal ganglion cells of each circuit were grouped into four stratification groups based on the peak of their dendritic profile. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 two proportion z-test.
