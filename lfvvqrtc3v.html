After deep anesthesia (120 Âµl of Ketamine (100 mg/ml) and Xylamine (2%) in saline per 20 g body weight), eyes were gently touched with a soldering iron (Weller, BP650) to label the nasal part of the cornea and then enucleated. The retinas were extracted in 1x PBS (Diluted from 10x PBS (VWR, 437117K), pH 7.4) and three cuts were made to label the nasal, dorsal and ventral retina.</div>
