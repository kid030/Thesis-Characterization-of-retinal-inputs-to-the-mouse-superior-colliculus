<div>To determine if visual features are selectively sampled by two targeted output pathways of the mouse superior colliculus, we used rabies-based viral tools to label retinal ganglion cells innervating either the colliculo-parabigeminal or colliculo-pulvinar circuit. Three properties of the labeled ganglion cells were characterized. First, we reconstructed each cell’s anatomy, with a particular focus on quantifying its dendritic depth profile within the retina. If available, this was combined with information about each cell’s molecular identity based on labeling by different antibodies, and subsequently matched to cell types within the database of the Eyewire Museum (<a href="http://museum.eyewire.org/">http://museum.eyewire.org</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>). Finally, the visual response properties of a subset of labeled neurons were measured.</div><div>To perform these experiments, we injected the parabigeminal nucleus or lateral pulvinar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig1">Figure 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig1s2">2</a>) with herpes-simplex virus (HSV) expressing rabies-G, TVA and mCherry, and subsequently injected EnvA-coated rabies virus coding for GCaMP6s (EnvA-SADΔG-GCaMP6s) into the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). This transsynaptic viral infection strategy resulted in the expression of GCaMP6s in several dozen retinal ganglion cells per retina that specifically innervate the targeted circuit. To infect neurons projecting to the lateral pulvinar we utilized a floxed version of the HSV virus (hEF1a-LS1L-TVA950-T2A-RabiesG-IRES-mCherry) in combination with the&nbsp;<i>Ntsr1-GN209Cre</i>&nbsp;mouse line, which ensured labeling of wide-field neurons of the superior colliculus that project to the lateral pulvinar and not adjacent thalamic nuclei (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib33">Gale and Murphy, 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib31">Gale and Murphy, 2014</a>).</div>
