The SCS received direct inputs from contralateral retinal ganglion cells (RGC).&nbsp;Different RGC types project to different sublaminar within the SGC. For example, on-off direction-selective (ooDS) cells project to the upper uSGC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2010}</cite>, alpha ganglion cells project to the lSGS (ref). lSGC also receives ipsilateral retinal inputs from the primary and extrastriate visual cortex. The deeper SC receives sensory inputs from multiple modalities, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the auditory nuclei of the midbrain, the trigeminal nucleus of</div><div>the brainstem, and visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex. Deep layers of the SC also contain premotor neurons that control rapid eye movements known as saccades (???).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div>
