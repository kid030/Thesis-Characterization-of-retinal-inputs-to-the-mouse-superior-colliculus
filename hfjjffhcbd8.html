<div>The percentages of CART+&nbsp;and SMI32+&nbsp;cells in each circuit from these experiments are consistent with the proportions observed in our single-cell analysis (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>), where we found that 7% of all labeled cells in the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit were in cluster 4 (putative ON-OFF direction-selective cells), and 44% were in clusters 1, 6, 11 and 13 (putative alpha ganglion cells). Similarly, in the colliculo-pulvinar circuit&nbsp;&lt;0.1% of the ganglion cells were classified as ON-OFF direction-selective and 51% were alpha cells. Furthermore, the distribution of each alpha cell type between the two circuits matches the distributions we found after anatomical classification, where the OFF types were innervating both circuits, while the transient ON-alpha cells showed a strong preference for the colliculo-pulvinar and the sustained ON-alpha for the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit. We found that transient OFF-alpha cells were underrepresented and sustained OFF-alpha cells overrepresented in our anatomical data set (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>), compared to the molecular analysis (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Despite the different proportions among the SMI32+&nbsp;cells, in both data sets, both OFF types are found to innervate each circuit.</div><h3>Functional properties of retinal ganglion cells support anatomical classification</h3>
