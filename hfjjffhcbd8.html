<div>The percentages of CART+&nbsp;and SMI32+&nbsp;cells in each circuit from these experiments are consistent with the proportions observed in our single-cell analysis (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>), where we found that 7% of all labeled cells in the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit were in cluster 4 (putative ON-OFF direction-selective cells), and 44% were in clusters 1, 6, 11 and 13 (putative alpha ganglion cells). Similarly, in the colliculo-pulvinar circuit&nbsp;&lt;0.1% of the ganglion cells were classified as ON-OFF direction-selective and 51% were alpha cells. Furthermore, the distribution of each alpha cell type between the two circuits matches the distributions we found after anatomical classification, where the OFF types were innervating both circuits, while the transient ON-alpha cells showed a strong preference for the colliculo-pulvinar and the sustained ON-alpha for the colliculo-parabigeminal circuit. We found that transient OFF-alpha cells were underrepresented and sustained OFF-alpha cells overrepresented in our anatomical data set (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>), compared to the molecular analysis (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Despite the different proportions among the SMI32+&nbsp;cells, in both data sets, both OFF types are found to innervate each circuit.</div><h2 data-label="866778" class="ltx_title_subsection">Functional properties of retinal ganglion cells support anatomical classification</h2><div>To determine if the functional response properties of cells within a cluster are consistent, we performed two-photon targeted patch-clamp recordings from transsynaptically labeled neurons (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig4">Figure 4</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>). We presented each neuron with a set of visual stimuli that included the ‘chirp’ stimulus and a moving bar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>). For a subset of 48 of the recorded cells, we were able to retrieve the anatomy after recording. These cells are part of the data set that was assigned to anatomical cell types (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig2">Figure 2</a>). In order to test if cells in a given anatomical cluster have consistent light responses, we used the ‘chirp’ stimulus which can be used to distinguish between different ganglion cell types (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib48">Jouty et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib77">Roson et al., 2019</a>). For each of the clusters containing at least one of the 48 both traced and patched cells, we calculated the average response to the ‘chirp’ stimulus and used it as a template (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). We then assigned each of the remaining retrogradely labeled patched retinal ganglion cells without anatomical data (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;75) to one of the anatomical clusters based on the similarity between the average response of the neuron and the templates, using three distance metrics (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods). A cell was assigned to a cluster if at least two distance measurements ranked the cluster in the top two, if the distance measurements did not agree with each other, the cluster with the highest linear correlation coefficient was taken (see Materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;methods).</div><div>To determine if the functional response properties of cells within a cluster are consistent, we performed two-photon targeted patch-clamp recordings from transsynaptically labeled neurons (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig4">Figure 4</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>).

For each of the retinal ganglion cell, we mapped its size onto its position within the retina. This revealed the expected general increase of dendritic size with distance from the optic nerve head for the whole ganglion cell population (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5A,E and I</a>). We then checked the spatial distribution of dendritic sizes of the sustained OFF and ON-alpha ganglion cells and the transient OFF-alpha cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5B–D</a>). It has previously been demonstrated that sustained ON and OFF-alpha cells, but not transient OFF-alpha cells show a strong asymmetric decrease of dendritic size along the naso-temporal axis (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib9">Bleckert et al., 2014</a>). We found that the two sustained types show the previously reported negative correlation along the naso-temporal axis with small neurons found preferentially in the temporal retina (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5F–G</a>), and also replicated the equal distribution with respect to the distance from the optic nerve head (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5J–K</a>). As expected, we did not observe any asymmetry in dendritic size of transient OFF-alpha cells along the naso–temporal axis (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5H–L</a>) (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib9">Bleckert et al., 2014</a>). In addition, while transient OFF-alpha cells do not show an asymmetric distribution of dendritic size, they do display an increasing response duration along the ventral – dorsal axis of the retina (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib97">Warwick et al., 2018</a>). We found a similar increase in response duration for transient OFF-alpha neurons along this axis of the retina that was consistent, though with a weaker correlation, with&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib97">Warwick et al. (2018)</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig5">Figure 5M–P</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that our assignment of cell types based on anatomy are consistent with the known spatial distributions of anatomical and physiological characteristics of ganglion cells across the retina.</div><h2 data-label="288275" class="ltx_title_subsection">Some visual responses of pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus are explained by selective innervation of retinal ganglion cell types</h2>
