<div>The output of the mammalian retina, the first stage of visual processing, consists of over 30 different ganglion cell types which can be distinguished by their dendritic anatomy, response properties, or molecular markers (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib4">Baden et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib5">Bae et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib22">Dhande et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib28">Farrow and Masland, 2011</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib56">Levick, 1967</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib63">Martersteck et al., 2017</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib76">Roska and Werblin, 2001</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib79">Sanes and Masland, 2015</a>). Each ganglion cell type informs one or several brain areas about a certain feature of the visual world (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib24">Ellis et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib63">Martersteck et al., 2017</a>). One of the major retinorecipient areas is the superior colliculus, which receives approximately 85% of the retinal outputs in rodents (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib24">Ellis et al., 2016</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib40">Hofbauer and Dr√§ger, 1985</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib58">Linden and Perry, 1983</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib94">Vaney et al., 1981</a>).</div>
