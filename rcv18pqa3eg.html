<div>Following injection, the wound was closed using Vetbond tissue adhesive (3M,1469). After surgery, mice were allowed to recover on top of a heating pad and were provided with soft food and water containing antibiotics (emdotrim, ecuphar, BE-V235523).</div><div></div><div>Mouse retinas were extracted eight days after the rabies virus injection into the superior colliculus. After deep anesthesia (120 Âµl of Ketamine (100 mg/ml) and Xylamine (2%) in saline per 20 g body weight), eyes were gently touched with a soldering iron (Weller, BP650) to label the nasal part of the cornea and then enucleated. The retinas were extracted in 1x PBS (Diluted from 10x PBS (VWR, 437117K), pH 7.4) and three cuts were made to label the nasal, dorsal and ventral retina.</div>
