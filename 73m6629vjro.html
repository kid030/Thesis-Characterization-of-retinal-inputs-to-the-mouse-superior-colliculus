<div>We found that neurons in both the posterior pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus responded reliably to a set of visual stimuli (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6G</a>) that includes: a large fast moving square (‘big-fast’, 53° side length, 150°/s); a small, fast moving spot (‘small-fast’, 4° diameter, 150°/s) and expanding discs (expanding from 2° to 50° of diameter within 300 ms). However, the percentages of responding units (maximal response&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;mean spontaneous firing rate + two std) differed for the different stimuli between the parabigeminal nucleus and the pulvinar (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#fig6">Figure 6F</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697/figures#fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</a>). Both responded to small, slow stimuli (diameter&nbsp;=&nbsp;4°, speed&nbsp;=&nbsp;21°/s) and expanding discs, however, more parabigeminal neurons responded to fast stimuli (150°/s) while the number of neurons responding to large, slow (size&nbsp;=&nbsp;53°, speed&nbsp;=&nbsp;21°/s) and dimming objects was larger in the pulvinar.</div>
