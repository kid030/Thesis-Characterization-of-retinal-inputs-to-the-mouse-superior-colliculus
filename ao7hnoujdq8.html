<div><b>Rabies virus production</b></div><div>Rabies production method was similar to previously published methods (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib71">Osakada and Callaway, 2013</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib101">Yonehara et al., 2013</a>). Glycoprotein G-coated, G-deleted B19 rabies virus (G-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV) was amplified in B7GG cells, which express rabies glycoprotein G. For amplification, approximately 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;infectious units of G-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV were used to infect five 10 cm plates of 80% confluent B7GG cells followed by 2–6 hr of incubation. Then, infected B7GG cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin (Thermo, 25300054) and split into twenty-five 10 cm plates. To harvest the virus, we collected the supernatant of the infected cells every 3 days. 5–6 harvests were performed. To concentrate the virus, the supernatant was firstly centrifuged at 2500 RPM and filtered (VWR, 514–0027) to get rid of the cell debris. Then the virus was spun in an ultracentrifuge for 5–12 hr at 25,000 RPM and at 4°C. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was dissolved in 200 µl of the original cell culture supernatant. The virus was tittered by counting a culture of infected BHK cells. To produce EnvA-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV, approximately 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;infectious units of G-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV were used to infect BHK-EnvA cells. The same procedure as for the G-coated RV amplification was then applied. EnvA-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV was tittered by infection of HEK293T-TVA cells. The titer used for injection ranged from 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;to 10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;infectious units/ml (IU/ml).</div><h2 data-label="501047" class="ltx_title_subsection">Method details</h2><div>Animals were quickly anesthetized with Isoflurane (Iso-vet 1000 mg/ml) and then injected with a mixture of Ketamine and Medetomidine (0.75 mL Ketamine (100 mg/mL) + 1 mL Medetomidine (1 mg/mL) + 8.2 mL Saline). Mice were placed in a stereotaxic workstation (Narishige, SR-5N). Dura tear (NOVARTIS, 288/28062–7) was applied to protect the eyes. To label the ganglion cells in the parabigeminal nucleus circuit, we performed the surgery on wild type mice and injected herpes-simplex-virus (HSV, hEF1a-TVA950-T2A-rabiesG-IRES-mCherry, MIT viral core, RN714) and EnvA-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s RV. In our experiment, we used&nbsp;<i>PV-Cre</i>&nbsp;mice as wild type mice. For the first injection of HSV into the parabigeminal nucleus, we used micropipettes (Wiretrol II capillary micropipettes, Drumond Scientific, 5-000-2005) with an open tip of around 30 µm and an oil-based hydraulic micromanipulator MO-10 (Narishige) for stereotactic injections. Alternatively, we used an oil-based microinjector IM-9B (Narishige) with the corresponding micropipettes (Warner Instrument, G100-4) with an open tip of 30 µm. The injection coordinates for a 4 weeks old mouse with a bregma-lambda distance of 4.7 mm were AP: −4.20; ML:±1.95; DV: 3.50 mm. As the mice were different in body size, we adjusted the coordinates for each mouse according to their bregma-lambda distance. To label the injection sites, DiD (Thermo, D7757) was used to coat the pipette tip. We injected in total 100–400 nl HSV in single doses of up to 200 nl with a waiting time of 5–10 min after each injection. Twenty-one days later, we injected rabies virus (EnvA-coated SAD-ΔG-GCaMP6s) into the superior colliculus using the same method as for the HSV injections. The retinotopic location of the first injection into the parabigeminal nucleus or the pulvinar is unknown. To maximize the labelling of ganglion cells in the retina, we thus covered as much as possible of the superficial layer of the superior colliculus during the second injection. We injected 100–200 nl of rabies virus at a depth of 1.7–1.8 mm at four different locations within a 1 mm<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;field anterior of lambda and starting at the midline.</div>
