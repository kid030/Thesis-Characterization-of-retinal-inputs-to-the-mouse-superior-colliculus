<h2 data-label="782397" class="ltx_title_subsection">1.2 Retinal ganglion cells represent the visual features to the brain</h2><div>Retinal ganglion cells are the output of retina and the only portal to the brain. Lettvin and colleagues, in the ‘What the frog’s eye tells the frog’s brain’, have shown that different types of retinal ganglion cells inform the brain about distinct visual features (Lettvin et al 1959). Classification of the retinal ganglion cell types is the key to understand what the eyes tell the brain. The ganglion cells are heterogeneous&nbsp;in many ways:  morphology, preferred response stimuli, presynaptic inputs, postsynaptic brain targets,  and molecular expression patterns. Besides, all RGCs also share several features. Their somata are located in the ganglion cell layer, their spine-free dendrites arborize in the IPL, and their exons travel through the optic nerve to different brain areas (see the projection of the RGCs).  Molecularly, pan-RGC markers include the cell surface protein Thy1,  transcription factors of the Brn3 (Pou4F) family, and the RNA-binding protein  RBPMS. By combining&nbsp;several parameters, retinal ganglion cells can be divided into at least 30 types. Some of them that have more distinguishable features and have been well characterized are summarized in the following sections. </div><div><b><i>On-Off direction-selective ganglion  cells (ooDSGCs)&nbsp;</i></b></div><div>ooDSGCs respond to both light and dark edges moving along a  particular direction with a broad range of speeds (up to 60 deg/s) (Oyster et  al 1972, Weng et al 2005, Sivyer et al 2010). They have a similar bistratified  dendritic morphology, with dendrites tightly aligned with both ON and OFF  dendrites of starburst amacrine cells. Molecularly, the neuropeptide CART  (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) distinguishes all ooDSGCs from other types of RGCs (Kay et al 2011). Based on the directional preference, they are further divided into four discrete subtypes that are sensitive to upward,  downward, backward, and forward motion direction, respectively (Oyster &amp;  Barlow 1967, Elstrott et al 2008). Each type forms a separate mosaic and could be labeled in different transgenetic mouse lines (ref).&nbsp;</div><div><b><i>On direction-selective ganglion  cells&nbsp;(On DSGCs)&nbsp;</i></b></div><div>On DSGCs respond to only light but not dark edges moving along a particular axis of the visual field with a slower movement speed than that of ooDSGCs. Their monostratified dendrites stratify with the ON starburst cells in the IPL. On DSGCs consist of three subtypes, each responds best to motion in one direction: upward, backward, and forward.&nbsp;</div><div><b><i>Alpha ganglion cells (</i></b><b>αRGCs)</b></div><div>αRGCs have monostratified morphology with their dendrites stratifying at different depths of IPL. They have relatively large somas and dendritic arbor size and are neurofilament rich (SMI32 antibody positive).  Based&nbsp; on the response properties of their receptive field centers and stratification level, αRGCs are divided into four subtypes: On-transient,  On-sustained, Off-transient, and Off sustained (Pang et al .2003, van Wyk et  al. 2009, Stafford et al 2010)</div><div><b><i>Intrinsically photosensitive  melanopsin-containing ganglion cells&nbsp;(ipRGCs)</i></b></div><div>ipRGCs occupies less than 2% of all RGCs in the retina. They  have large dendritic arbor and express melanopsin, which empowers them an  intrinsic sensitivity to light. They display sustained responses to steady  illumination and thereby encode global light intensity levels in the ambient  environment (Zhao et al 2014). Five ipRGCs (M1-M5) have been identified, all  but one of which is monostratified, and each of which posses a different level  of intrinsic photosensitivity attributable to varying levels of melanopsin  expression (Ecker et al 2010, Hu et al 2013).&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="604408" class="ltx_title_subsection">1.3 Central projection  areas receive independent and diverse visual features</h2><div>The retinorecipient areas contain more than 40 different  brain structures, each of which receives direct input from different types of retinal ganglion cells  (Morin &amp; Studholme 2014) (Figxxx). The retinofugal pathways  can be separated based on their functional distinction, into two general  categories: non-image-forming versus image-forming pathways. The  non-image-forming pathways include circuits that govern the core physical  function of the whole-animal, such as&nbsp;the entrainment of the circadian  rhythm and control the light-driven involuntary reflexive behaviors, such as  the pupillary light reflex (PLR) and eye movements that ensure image  stabilization. In contrast, image-forming pathways are responsible for encoding  complex visual features (motion direction, contrast, color, and  locations)&nbsp; and involve conscious perception.&nbsp;</div><div><b><i>Non-image-forming  pathways</i></b></div><div>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes the circadian  clock in the bain. It synchronizes the&nbsp;endogenous rhythm to a 24-hour  cycle and is coupled to the ambient light-dark cycle. The SCN receives  predominately input from M1 and M2 ipRGCs, and they appear to innervate  distinct subregions of SCN. M1 ipRGCs that lack the transcription factor Brn3b  target the SCN, whereas Brn3b+ 1 ipRGCs target the shell of the olivary  pretectal nucleus (OPN), which is a critical hub in the central PLR pathway.  Specifically killing the OPN-projecting M1 Brn3b+ neurons resulted in an  abrogated PLR (Chen et al 201). There are also other non-M1 ipRGCs projecting to  the core of OPN, but their contributions to PLR remain to be determined. The  optokinetic reflex (OKR) and the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR)&nbsp; system work  in concert over both slow and fast movement to elicit the compensatory eye  movements necessary to gaze stabilization.&nbsp; Direction selective RGCs and  their targeted brainstem targets of the accessory optic system (AOS), namely  optic tract (NOT) and the dorsal and medial of the terminal nuclei (DTN and  MTN), has been implicated in&nbsp;driving the OKR.&nbsp;In detail, both  On-DSGCs and ooDSGCs encoding forward motion project to the NOT and DTN and are  involved in generating horizontal reflexive eye movement. The dorsal and  ventral MTN receive input from On-DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion,  respectively, and drive vertical eye movement.&nbsp; (Figurexx)</div><div><b><i>Image-forming  pathways</i></b></div><div><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="191309">Imaging-forming  visual pathways involve a number of subcortical retinorecipient brain targets,  which could further be divided into two categories. Some of those structures,  such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and lateral posterior nucleus  (LP), relay retinal information directly to visual cortex, which have a  direct and necessary role in conscious vision. On the other hand, the superior colliculus receives direct input from  the retina and further &nbsp;project the  visual information to other downstream areas, such as parabigeminal nuclei (Pbg),  dLGN and LP. The SC has been implicated in triggering innate defensive  behabiors such as looming-evoked escape and freezing in multiple species. </span></div><h1 data-label="377348" class="ltx_title_section">2. The mouse superior colliculus </h1><h2 data-label="833619" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="833619" class="ltx_title_subsection">2.1 Organization of the superior colliculus</h2><div>The organization of the mouse SC has been characterized along multiple dimensions. First, the SC is a multisensory integration structure. It  can be divided based on its input sources with superficial&nbsp;(dorsal) layers being visual and deeper (ventral) layers being multimodal and motor-related (May 2006, Stein 1984). The superficial layers of the SC are the major retino-recipient structure in the brain and can be further divided into several synaptic layers. Stratum zonale (SZ)&nbsp;is&nbsp;a thin, neuronal cell-sparse layer, immediately under the pial surface. Below the SZ is&nbsp;stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), or the superficial gray layer, where most RGC axons arborize. Below the SGS is the stratum opticum (SO), or the optic layers, where RGC axons enter the SC. The SO is mostly made up of retinal afferent fibers, it contains scattered neurons as well. The superficial layers of the SC also receive input from the striate and extratriate visual cortex (Wang &amp; Burkhalter 2013). The deeper layers of the SC consist of stratum griseum intermedium (SGI) and below. These layers have multiple sources of innervation, such as inputs from the somatosensory cortex (S1), auditory cortex and trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, as well as visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Second, each of these modalities is topographical mapped and aligned with the others, which allows the SC to initiate behavioral responses to multimodal stimuli (Cang &amp; Feldheim 2013).&nbsp;Retinal inputs to the superficial layers of the SC are mapped topographically such that SGS and SO neurons represent the two-dimensional visual field along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes of the SC (Fig. 1A). The somatosensory and auditory inputs are organized into topographic maps that are aligned with the visual maps, such that neurons in the same vertical column have corresponding receptive field locations, either in visual and auditory space or on the body surface (Drager &amp; Hubel 1975, Stein 1984). These sensory maps are also aligned with motor maps in the deep layers of the SC that encode the direction and amplitude of saccadic eye and head movement (Sparks et al. 1990, Wurtz &amp; Albano 1980).&nbsp;Besides, the cortical inputs that terminate in the lower SGC and deeper layers are also topographically organized aligned in register with retinal inputs (Triplett et al 2009) (Fig. 1B).&nbsp; The alignment of these maps enables the SC to integrate visual, auditory, and tactile information and to initiate orienting movements to redirect attention toward salient stimuli.</div>
