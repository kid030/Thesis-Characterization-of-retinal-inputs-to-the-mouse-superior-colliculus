<h2 data-label="782397" class="ltx_title_subsection">1.2 Retinal ganglion cells represent the visual features to the brain</h2><div>Retinal ganglion cells are the output of retina and the only portal to the brain. Lettvin and colleagues, in the ‘What the frog’s eye tells the frog’s brain’, have shown that different types of retinal ganglion cells inform the brain about distinct visual features (Lettvin et al 1959). Classification of the retinal ganglion cell types is the key to understand what the eyes tell the brain. The ganglion cells are heterogeneous&nbsp;in many ways:  morphology, preferred response stimuli, presynaptic inputs, postsynaptic brain targets,  and molecular expression patterns. Besides, all RGCs also share several features. Their somata are located in the ganglion cell layer, their spine-free dendrites arborize in the IPL, and their exons travel through the optic nerve to different brain areas (see the projection of the RGCs).  Molecularly, pan-RGC markers include the cell surface protein Thy1,  transcription factors of the Brn3 (Pou4F) family, and the RNA-binding protein  RBPMS. By combining&nbsp;several parameters, retinal ganglion cells can be divided into at least 30 types. Some of them that have more distinguishable features  and have been well characterized are summarized in the following sections. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b><i>On-Off direction-selective ganglion  cells (ooDSGCs)&nbsp;</i></b></div><div>ooDSGCs respond to both light and dark edges moving along a  particular direction with a broad range of speeds (up to 60 deg/s) (Oyster et  al 1972, Weng et al 2005, Sivyer et al 2010). They have a similar bistratified  dendritic morphology, with dendrites tightly aligned with both ON and OFF  dendrites of starburst amacrine cells. Molecularly, the neuropeptide CART  (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) distinguishes all ooDSGCs from  other types of RGCs (Kay et al 2011). Based on the directional preference, they  are further divided into four discrete subtypes that are sensitive to upward,  downward, backward, and forward motion direction, respectively (Oyster &amp;  Barlow 1967, Elstrott et al 2008). Each type forms a separate mosaic and could  be labeled in different transgenetic mouse lines (ref).&nbsp;</div><div><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></div><div><b><i>On direction-selective ganglion  cells&nbsp;(On DSGCs)&nbsp;</i></b></div><div>On DSGCs respond to only light but not dark edges moving  along a particular axis of the visual field with a slower movement speed than  that of ooDSGCs. Their monostratified dendrites stratify with the ON starburst  cells in the IPL. On DSGCs consist of three subtypes, each responds best to  motion in one direction: upward, backward, and forward.&nbsp;</div><div><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></div><div><b><i>Alpha ganglion cells (</i></b><b>αRGCs)</b></div><div>αRGCs have monostratified morphology with their dendrites  stratifying at different depths of IPL. They have relatively large somas and  dendritic arbor size and are neurofilament rich (SMI32 antibody positive).  Based&nbsp; on the response properties of their receptive field centers and  stratificationlevel, αRGCs are divided into four subtypes: On-transient,  On-sustained, Off-transient, and Off sustained (Pang et al .2003, van Wyk et  al. 2009, Stafford et al 2010)</div><div><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></div><div><b><i>Intrinsically photosensitive  melanopsin-containing ganglion cells&nbsp;(ipRGCs)</i></b></div><div>ipRGCs occupies less than 2% of all RGCs in the retina. They  have large dendritic arbor and express melanopsin, which empowers them an  intrinsic sensitivity to light. They display sustained responses to steady  illumination and thereby encode global light intensity levels in the ambient  environment (Zhao et al 2014). Five ipRGCs (M1-M5) have been identified, all  but one of which is monostratified, and each of which posses a different level  of intrinsic photosensitivity attributable to varying levels of melanopsin  expression (Ecker et al 2010, Hu et al 2013).&nbsp;</div>
