<h3 data-label="746322" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"> </h3><div>individual SC  layers contain topographic maps of the sensory periphery or motor commands, and</div><div>these maps horizontal  cells are in register  across layers. The alignment made up of these maps allows </div><div>the SC to  integrate multisensory information two anatomically and functionally distinct populations</div><div>defined by  their projections to initiate orienting movements toward salient stimuli. Retinal  inputs to the</div><div>superficial  layer are mapped topographically with respect to the visual field. Temporal-nasal  (T-N) axis</div><div>of the retina  projects along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the SC, LGN and the  dorsal-ventral (D-V)</div><div>axis Pbg.  Manipulating of these two distinct populations that targets either LGN and PBg  results</div><div>in di erent  behavior outputs.

Retinal</div><div>connections  between specific retinal inputs from contralateral and ipsilateral eys, and V1, and other</div><div>sensory  inputs are all topographically organized (Triplett 2009, Triplett 2012).
