<div>The rodent superior colliculus is a layered brain structure that receives inputs from all sensory modalities and targets various nuclei of the midbrain and brainstem. The superficial gray and the optic layer form the most dorsal layers of the superior colliculus and are primarily innervated by the retina (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib64">May, 2006</a>). These visual layers consist of several groups of neurons with diverse morphology, visual response properties and long-range targets that include the lateral pulvinar, lateral geniculate nucleus and parabigeminal nucleus. Each neuron of the superficial superior colliculus has been estimated to receive input from on average six retinal ganglion cells (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib10">Chandrasekaran et al., 2007</a>). However, the different ganglion cell types that provide input to specific superior collicular output pathways have not been characterized. As a result, it is unknown whether the different output pathways of the superior colliculus have a common or different sets of retinal inputs, and consequently whether different visual inputs give rise to the different behaviors initiated by the colliculus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib20">Dean et al., 1989</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib26">Evans et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib84">Shang et al., 2018</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib83">Shang et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib98">Wei et al., 2015</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib106">Zhang et al., 2019</a>).</div>
