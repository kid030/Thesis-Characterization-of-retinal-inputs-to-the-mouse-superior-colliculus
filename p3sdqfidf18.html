<h2>Luminance level</h2><div>The range of intensities the retina can operate at covers about 10<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>by using two classes of photoreceptors, namely the rods and the cones. The corresponding broad categories of light intensity are called scotopic (only rods are active, starlight vision), mesopic (both rods and cones are active), and photopic (rods are saturated, and only cones are active, daylight vision). Rods and cones convet their signals through specialized circuits, eventially converging onto retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. There are more than 40 different functional types, each of them transmitting information to the brain about ta certain subset of features of the image stream impinging onto the photoreceptors. The specific response pattern of each ganglion cell type is largely shaped by the connectivity with the presynaptic circuitry and the precise Spatio-temporal interactions of all cells involved (bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells). Sophisticated response patterns produced by retinal ganglion cells include direction-selective response, approach-sensitive response, object-specific motion sensitivity, or color specificity.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="249070" class="ltx_title_subsection">Superior Colliculus</h2><div>Superior colliculus (SC) is an integrative sensorimotor structure that receives inputs from multi-sensory modalities. </div><h3 data-label="943828" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="943828" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">SC structure and its inputs and outputs</h3><div>SC is organized into several synaptic layers, each of which as distinct sources of innervation. Around 85-90% retinal inputs terminates at the SC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ellis_2016}</cite>. </div><div></div><div>SC is organized into several synaptic layers:&nbsp; the stratum zonale (SZ), a thin layer located just below the pial surface; the stratum griseum superficialis (SGS) where most RGC axons arborize, and which can itself be further divided into upper (uSGS) and lower (lSGS) sublayers; the stratum opticum (SO); deeper SC, which can be further subdivided into stratum griseum intermidiaum (SGI) and below (dSC). </div><div>There are several features of SC organization, which are conserved among different species. First, inputs to the SC are organized according to modality along the superficial to deep axis, with superficial layers being visual and deeper layers multimodal and premotor. Second,each of these layers has distinct sources of innervation. The SCS received direct inputs from contralateral retinal ganglion cells (RGC).&nbsp;Different RGC types project to different sublaminar within the SGC. For example, on-off direction-selective (ooDS) cells project to the upper uSGC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2010}</cite>, alpha ganglion cells project to the lSGS (ref). lSGC also receives ipsilateral retinal inputs from the primary and extrastriate visual cortex. The deeper SC receives sensory inputs from multiple modalities, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the auditory nuclei of the midbrain, the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, and visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex. Deep layers of the SC  contain premotor neurons that control rapid eye movements known as saccades (???).&nbsp; </div><div>Third,&nbsp;individual SC layers contain topographic maps of the sensory periphery or motor commands, and these maps are in register across layers. The alignment of these maps allows the SC to integrate multisensory information and to initiate orienting movements toward salient stimuli.</div><div>T</div><div>Within each SC lamina, inputs are mapped topographically with respect to the visual field, and are aligned in retinotopic register with each other. Contralateral RGCs that project to the most superficial lamina of the SC are organized such that the temporal–nasal (T–N) axis of the retina projects along the anterior–posterior (A–P) axis of the SC, and the dorsal–ventral (D–V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral–medial (L–M) axis of the SC. Ipsilateral RGCs and V1 axons terminate in a slightly deeper SGS lamina and are retinotopically aligned with the contralateral retinocollicular map. SC inputs from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), auditory brainstem and cortex, and other brainstem nuclei such as the inferior colliculus and trigeminal nucleus project to a deeper SC location than V1 axons in the SGI. Each of these projections is organized such that neurons from different sensory modalities that monitor the same portion of the environment terminate in register but in distinct laminae (Figure 1).A</div><div></div><div>Retinal inputs are mapped topographically such</div><div>that SGS and SO neurons represent the two-dimensional visual field along the anterior-posterior</div><div>and medial-lateral axes of the SC (Figure 1a).
