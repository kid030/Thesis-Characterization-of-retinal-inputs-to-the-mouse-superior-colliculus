<div></div><div>Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 microscope. Overview images of the retina and brain were obtained with a 10x (plan-APOCHROMAT 0.45 NA, Zeiss) objective. The following settings were used: zoom 0.7, 4 × 4 tiles with 0% to 15% overlap, 2.37 µm/pixel resolution. For single retina ganglion cell scanning, we used a 63x (plan-APOCHROMAT 1.4 NA, Zeiss) objective. The following settings were used: zoom 0.7, 2 × 2 tiles or more (depending on size and number of cells) with 0% to 15% overlap. This resulted in an XY-resolution of 0.38 µm/pixel and a Z-resolution between 0.25 and 0.35 µm/pixel. The Z-stacks covered approximately 50 µm in depth.<b></b></div>
