The visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells correlated well with those of their disynaptic targets. These findings open the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus.</div><div></div><div></div><div>innate behaviors, a specific visual features will be detected by the retina, which further sends these visual information to different brain areas.</div><div> The superior colliculus (SC) is a midbrain area that receives&nbsp;</div><div>one of the key structures that receives direct input from the retina, parse the information to different downstream circuits and&nbsp;mediate various defensive behaviors.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="963642" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Environmental threats elicit defensive behavioral responses that enable the animals to avoid or reduce harm and thus ensure their survival. Many mammals including humans rely on vision as their primary sense to evaluate the surroundings and guide their behavior. The visual processing starts from the retina, which sends the visual information to different brain areas. The superior colliculus (SC) is one of the key structures that receives direct input from the retina, parse the information to different downstream circuits and&nbsp;mediate various defensive behaviors.</div><h2 data-label="812202" class="ltx_title_subsection">Retina and retinal ganglion cell types</h2><div>The eyes are the sole entry point for visual information to reach the brain. The retina that is located at the back of the eye is a thin neural tissue. It contains five classes of neurons including photoreceptors which detect the light and covert photons into eletronical signals; horizontal, bipolar and amacrine cells, which are interneurons that process the output of photorecoeptors; and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose exons convey visual information to the brain through the optic nevre.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="401368" class="ltx_title_subsection">Superious colliculus and its organization </h2><div>Superior colliculus is an integrative sensorimotor structure that receives inputs from multi-sensory modalities. It is organized into several synaptic layers. The most dorsal layer stratum zonale (SZ) is a thin layer located just below the pial surface. The stratum griseum superficialis (SGS) where most RGC axons arborize, can be further divided into upper (uSGS), lower (lSGS) sublayers and the stratum opticum (SO). The deeper SC, which receives mostly non-visual inouts, can be further subdivided into stratum griseum intermidiaum (SGI) and below (dSC).&nbsp;</div><div>There are three key features of SC organization, which are conserved among different species. First,  along the superficial to the deep axis with the superficial layers being visual, which receives around&nbsp;85-90% retinal inputs&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ellis_2016}</cite> and deeper layers multimodal and premotor. Second, each of these layers has distinct sources of innervation, each of the SC layers as distinct sources of innervation. Within the SGC,&nbsp; different RGC types also project to different sublaminar.&nbsp;The SCS received direct inputs from contralateral retinal ganglion cells (RGC). For example, on-off direction-selective (ooDS) cells project to the upper uSGC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2010}</cite>, alpha ganglion cells project to the lSGS (ref). lSGC also receives ipsilateral retinal inputs from the primary and extrastriate visual cortex. The deeper SC receives sensory inputs from multiple modalities, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the auditory nuclei of the midbrain, the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem, and visual inputs from the superficial SC and visual cortex. Deep layers of the SC  contain premotor neurons that control rapid eye movements known as saccades (???).&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;individual SC layers contain topographic maps of the sensory periphery or motor commands, and these maps are in register across layers. The alignment of these maps allows the SC to integrate multisensory information and to initiate orienting movements toward salient stimuli. Retinal inputs to the superficial layer are mapped topographically with respect to the visual field. Temporal-nasal (T-N) axis of the retina projects along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the SC, and the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the retina projects along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the SC. Retinal inputs from contralateral and ipsilateral eys, and V1, and other sensory inputs are all topographically organized&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Triplett_2009,Triplett_2012}</cite>. This organization enables neurons from different sensory modalities that monitor the same position of the environment terminate in the register but in distinct laminar.&nbsp;</div>
