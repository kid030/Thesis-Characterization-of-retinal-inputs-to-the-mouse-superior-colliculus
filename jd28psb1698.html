<div>Surgical procedureEight&nbsp;<i>PV-Cre</i>&nbsp;mice of either sex at the age of 2–2.5 months were quickly anesthetized with Isoflurane (Iso-vet 1000 mg/ml) and then either maintained under Isoflurane anesthesia or injected with a mixture of Ketamine and Medetomidine (0.75 mL Ketamine (100 mg/mL) + 1 mL Medetomidine (1 mg/mL) + 8.2 mL Saline). Lidocaine (0.5%, 0.007 mg/g body weight) was injected under the skin above the skull, the animal’s head was shaved, the skin and muscle tissue removed, and a titanium head plate fixed to the skull using dental cement (Metabond, Crown and Bridge). After recovery from anesthesia animals were single-housed and were administrated Buprenorphine and Cefazolin for 60 hr post-surgery (Buprenorphine 0.2 mg/kg I.P. and Cefazolin 15 mg/kg I.P. in 12 hr intervals) and Dexamethasone (max. 0.2 ml of 0.1 mg/ml/day) depending on the condition of the animal. After this recovery phase animals were habituated for 3–4 days to the recording setup in sessions of increasing head-fixed time. One day before the first recording, the animals were anesthetized with Isoflurane and small craniotomies were performed (approximately 100 µm diameter, elongated to up to 300 µm laterally for parabigeminal coordinates and posteriorly for pulvinar coordinates). Coordinates were adjusted to each mouse’s skull size based on standard coordinates for a bregma-lambda distance of 4.7 mm. Standard coordinates pulvinar: bregma −2.0/1.7 lateral. Parabigeminal nucleus: bregma −4.2/2.0 lateral.</div><div></div><div>Presentation of visual stimuli</div><div>A calibrated 32-inch LCD monitor (Samsung S32E590C, 1920 × 1080 pixel resolution, 60 Hz refresh rate, average luminance of 2.6 cd/m2) was positioned 35 cm in front of the right eye, so that the screen was covering 90° of azimuth and 70° of altitude of the right visual field. Visual stimuli were presented on a gray background (50% luminance), controlled by Octave (GNU Octave) and Psychtoolbox (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib52">Kleiner et al., 2007</a>). The following visual stimuli were used:</div><div>Large moving square</div><div>A black square of 53° side length moved with a speed of 150 °/sec across the screen in eight direction (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°).

After 3 s at a gray screen, the contrast was modulated from 0% to 100% over a time period of 5.5 s at 2 Hz. The stimulus was repeated 10 times.</div><div>Experimental design</div><div><a href="https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap50697?item=s4-3-4">Request a detailed protocol</a></div><div>Head-posted animals were fixed on a treadmill in front of the screen. For all pulvinar and some parabigeminal recordings, we coated the Neuropixels probe with a fluorescent dye (DiI, DiD or DiO, Thermo Fisher). The coordinates for the pulvinar (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 recordings) or parabigeminal nucleus (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;5) were measured again and the probe was slowly lowered into the brain using a micromanipulator. Some artificial cerebrospinal fluid (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM K, 10 mM D-glucose, 2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) was used to cover the skull. Then, the probe was lowered to the desired depth. In most cases, the probe was inserted further than the targeted brain area to ensure that the whole nucleus was covered. After 20–30 min, visual stimulation and recording of neural activity was started. The setup was covered with black curtains during the whole experiment.</div><div>Brain histology for probe location</div><div><a href="https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap50697?item=s4-3-5">Request a detailed protocol</a></div><div>To facilitate the identification of the pulvinar and the correct location of the probe, we injected Cholera Toxin Subunit B conjugated with Alexa488 (Thermo Fisher) into the contralateral eye to label retinal targets such as the laterogeniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Then, the brain was fixed and Vibratome sections (coronal at 100 µm) were collected in 1x PBS. The slices were washed in 1x PBS with 0.3% TritonX-100, then washed in 1x PBS and incubated for 20 min at RT with fluorescent Nissl Stain (NeuroTrace 435/455, Thermo Fisher, 1:150). Afterwards, the slices were washed in 1x PBS with 0.3% TritonX-100 and for at least 2 hr in 1x PBS. Brain slices were covered with mounting medium (Dako) and a glass coverslip, and imaged using a confocal microscope.</div><div>Probe trajectories were mapped by following DiI tracks that were typically visible across multiple slices. Recording locations along the track were manually identified by comparing structural aspects of the histological slice with features in the Allen Brain Atlas. This identification was aided by reconstruction of the track in the Allen CCF coordinates (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697#bib82">Shamash et al., 2018</a>). To achieve this, an initial guess was made of the 3D Allen CCF coordinate for each DiI track. This was aided by a control-point registration of the histological slice to an atlas slice. Once the coordinates were identified for each DiI mark along the track, a line was fitted to these coordinates in and the atlas labels were extracted from along this line. This resulted in identification of the list of brain regions each probe track and recording site passed through.</div>
