<div>Eight&nbsp;<i>PV-Cre</i>&nbsp;mice of either sex at the age of 2–2.5 months were quickly anesthetized with Isoflurane (Iso-vet 1000 mg/ml) and then either maintained under Isoflurane anesthesia or injected with a mixture of Ketamine and Medetomidine (0.75 mL Ketamine (100 mg/mL) + 1 mL Medetomidine (1 mg/mL) + 8.2 mL Saline). Lidocaine (0.5%, 0.007 mg/g body weight) was injected under the skin above the skull, the animal’s head was shaved, the skin and muscle tissue removed, and a titanium head plate fixed to the skull using dental cement (Metabond, Crown and Bridge). After recovery from anesthesia animals were single-housed and were administrated Buprenorphine and Cefazolin for 60 hr post-surgery (Buprenorphine 0.2 mg/kg I.P. and Cefazolin 15 mg/kg I.P. in 12 hr intervals) and Dexamethasone (max. 0.2 ml of 0.1 mg/ml/day) depending on the condition of the animal. After this recovery phase animals were habituated for 3–4 days to the recording setup in sessions of increasing head-fixed time. One day before the first recording, the animals were anesthetized with Isoflurane and small craniotomies were performed (approximately 100 µm diameter, elongated to up to 300 µm laterally for parabigeminal coordinates and posteriorly for pulvinar coordinates). Coordinates were adjusted to each mouse’s skull size based on standard coordinates for a bregma-lambda distance of 4.7 mm. Standard coordinates pulvinar: bregma −2.0/1.7 lateral. Parabigeminal nucleus: bregma −4.2/2.0 lateral.</div>
