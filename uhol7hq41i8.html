<div>Superior colliculus (SC) is an integrative sensorimotor structure that receives inputs from multi-sensory modalities. It is organized into several synaptic layers:&nbsp; the stratum zonale (SZ), a thin layer located just below the pial surface; the stratum griseum superficialis (SGS) where most RGC axons arborize, and which can itself be further divided into upper (uSGS) and lower (lSGS) sublayers; the stratum opticum (SO); deeper SC, which can be further subdivided into stratum griseum intermidiaum (SGI) and below (dSC). </div>
